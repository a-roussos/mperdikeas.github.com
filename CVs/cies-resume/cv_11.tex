  %\textit{A summary of your interests, achievements, history, topic of study or any other short summary of your professional life.}\\\\
  I have been coding in Java since version JDK 1.1 came out in 1997. Over the years I have written more than 200
  LoC in Java and have explored a wide array of technologies and frameworks in the landscape. 
  I am a proficient Emacs user (with an Emacs setup that I've honed over the years for maximum productivity)
  I like to live as close to the command line as possible
  and have no need of an IDE to hold my hand or ``help'' me in any way (though I can of course also use an IDE
  if required). I am a full stack Java engineer and have worked professionally in practically the entire
  stack from front-facing web services, rich client applications, server-side Java code all the way to the back-end relational
  database. I am also typically involved in devops stuff as well. That is, in addition to writing the code I also
  write the build system (Ant / Ivy), test cases, coding standards compliance checking, code coverage,
  integration testing, shel-scripting, etc.
  The browser is the only part of the stack where I haven't worked in a professionally capacity
  though I have ample experience in JavaScript in my playground projects and am currently exploring ReactJS in my
  free time.

{Software Architect and Lead Coder}
{March '13 -- June '15}
{\bodytext{I was the software architect and the sole coder for the
    \href{registry2.euro-vo.org}{new EuroVO Registry system}
  which is scheduled to replace the \href{registry.euro-vo.org}{existing EuroVO Registry system}.

  I worked for two years in ESAC, Madrid with no company supervision
  and designed and implemented the entire system from scratch with the exception of some parts
  of the front-end web-based GUI.
  Among others, I designed and implemented:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item the \href{http://www.openarchives.org/pmh/}{OAI-PMH} harvesting functionality. I couldn't find a reliable 3rd party OAI-PMH library
    so I implemented the entire protocol from scratch. \textbf{\emph{Technologies:}} Java, XPath 2.0 (Saxon), REST (Jersey), HTTP, JDBC
  \item the \href{http://www.ivoa.net/documents/RegTAP/}{RegTAP} functionality and interface. I came into the project with \textbf{zero} domain-specific
    knowledge and I managed to implement the second, globally, RegTAP search interface and make material
    contributions to the RegTAP specification itself to the effect that I was recognized as a co-author of the spec. \textbf{\emph{Technologies:}} Java, XPath 2.0 (Saxon), REST (Jersey), JDBC
  \item the \href{http://www.ivoa.net/documents/RegistryInterface/20091104/REC-RegistryInterface-1.0.pdf}{IVOA RI1} Search interface. This is SOAP interface, definined in WSDL (i.e. following a top-down approach). 
    Due to the complexity of the XSDs used by the IVOA community I ran into problems with the automatic stub
    generation by tools like wsimport (which I have documented and raised against). So I decided to implement
    my own wsimport-like tool that reads WSDL and generates Java code (stubs and skeletons) to perform SOAP calls. Technologies: Java, SOAP (Jersey), XSD, template-based code generation with \href{http://www.stringtemplate.org/.}{String Template}
    \item the report, email notifications and visual plots generation subsystem. Technologies: Java
    \item the entire database schema for PostgreSQL. I wrote the DDL statements for the entire database which comprises 102 tables in 4 schemas and was responsible for the installation, fine-tuning, index creation, performance optimization, etc of the PostgreSQL database.
    \item I also handled all devops aspects including: authoring the entire build system based on Ant and Ivy, writing test cases (JUnit), code
  \end{itemize}
