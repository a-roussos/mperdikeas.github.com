  %\textit{A summary of your interests, achievements, history, topic of study or any other short summary of your professional life.}\\\\
  I have been coding in Java since version JDK 1.1 came out in 1997. Over the years I have written more than 200
  LoC in Java and have explored a wide array of technologies and frameworks in the landscape. 
  I am a proficient Emacs user (with an Emacs setup that I've honed over the years for maximum productivity)
  I like to live as close to the command line as possible
  and have no need of an IDE to hold my hand or ``help'' me in any way (though I can of course also use an IDE
  if required). I am a full stack Java engineer and have worked professionally in practically the entire
  stack from front-facing web services, rich client applications, server-side Java code all the way to the back-end relational
  database. I am also typically involved in devops stuff as well. That is, in addition to writing the code I also
  write the build system (Ant / Ivy), test cases, coding standards compliance checking, code coverage,
  integration testing, shel-scripting, etc.
  The browser is the only part of the stack where I haven't worked in a professionally capacity
  though I have ample experience in JavaScript in my playground projects and am currently exploring ReactJS in my
  free time.

{Software Architect and Lead Coder}
{March '13 -- June '15}
{\bodytext{I was the software architect and the sole coder for the
    \href{registry2.euro-vo.org}{new EuroVO Registry system}
    which is scheduled to replace the \href{registry.euro-vo.org}{existing EuroVO Registry system} which has been
    serving the global \href{http://www.ivoa.net/}{IVOA} community for the last ten (10) years.

  I worked for two years with people from the \href{http://www.sciops.esa.int/index.php?project=SAT}{Science
    Archives Team at ESAC}, with no company supervision
  and designed and implemented the entire system from scratch with the exception of some parts
  of the front-end web-based GUI.
  Among others, I designed and implemented:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item the \href{http://www.openarchives.org/pmh/}{OAI-PMH} harvesting functionality. I couldn't find a reliable 3rd party OAI-PMH library
    so I implemented the entire protocol from scratch.\\
    \technologies{} Java, XPath 2.0 (Saxon), XSLT, REST (Jersey), HTTP
  \item the \href{http://www.ivoa.net/documents/RegTAP/}{RegTAP} functionality and interface. I came into the project with \textbf{zero} domain-specific
    knowledge and I managed to implement the second, globally, RegTAP search interface and make material
    contributions to the RegTAP specification itself to the effect that I was recognized as a co-author of the spec.\\
    \technologies{} Java, XPath 2.0 (Saxon), REST (Jersey), JDBC
  \item the \href{http://www.ivoa.net/documents/RegistryInterface/20091104/REC-RegistryInterface-1.0.pdf}{IVOA RI1} Search interface. This is SOAP interface, definined in WSDL (i.e. following a top-down approach). 
    Due to the complexity of the XSDs used by the IVOA community I ran into problems with the automatic stub
    generation by tools like wsimport (which I have documented and raised against). So I decided to implement
    my own wsimport-like tool that reads WSDL and generates Java code (stubs and skeletons) to perform SOAP calls.\\
    \technologies{} Java, SOAP (Jersey), XSD, template-based code generation with \href{http://www.stringtemplate.org/.}{String Template}
  \item the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Schema_(W3C)}{XML XSD schema-validation}
    and the IVOA validation of the various services.
    \\
    \technologies{} Java, XML, XSD, XPath 2.0 (Saxon), HTTP.
  \item the report, email notifications and visual plots generation subsystem.
    \\
    \technologies{}: Java, JFreeChart
    \item the entire database schema for PostgreSQL. I wrote the DDL statements for the entire database which comprises 102 tables in 4 schemas and was responsible for the installation, fine-tuning, index creation, performance optimization, etc of the PostgreSQL database. I also wrote the entire DB-facing \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_abstraction_layer}{DAO} code.\\
      \technologies{} PostgreSQL 9.2, JDBC.
    \item I also handled all DevOps aspects including: authoring the entire build system based on
      Ant and \href{http://ant.apache.org/ivy/}{Ivy}, writing test cases (JUnit), coding standards checking with \href{http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/}{Checkstyle}, source code analyzers with
      \href{https://pmd.github.io/}{PMD} and \href{http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/}{FindBugs},
      code coverage with \href{http://cobertura.github.io/cobertura/}{Cobertura}, etc.
  \end{itemize}

{Software Engineer}
{June '12 -- March '13}
{\bodytext{
    I worked as a software engineer in the company's flagship \href{https://www.neuropublic.gr/en/component/k2/gaia-epicheirein}{GAIA} series of cloud-based services.
    \\
    Among the things I did:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item designed and developed all the server-side code for an expert system that advises farmers
      on the subsidies they are entitled to apply for. I devised a formal way to capture the legal requirements
      for each subsidy in the form of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression}{Lisp S-expressions}.
      Essentially each subsidy ministerial decision is
      transformed into a Lisp-like \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language}{DSL}.
      Then the system reads from the database the profile of each user (age, income, past subsidies, location
      and size of fields, crops, animal capital) and dynamically evaluates them against all possible subsidies.
      The system finally informs the user which subsidies (s)he can apply for and also creates
      a visual diagram that explains to the users why the failed to qualify for certain subsidies.
      S-expressions were used in order to allow for dynamic evaluation and also because the company wanted
      the DSL for each ministerial decision to be created by business people. So S-expression were chosen
      as Lisp has no other syntax except the opening and closing parenthesis.\\
      \technologies{} \href{https://clojure.org/}{Clojure} (for
      the dynamic evaluation of the S-expressions), dynamic evaluation of Clojure code from Java,
      \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)}{DOT} (for visualizing
      subsidies criteria logic using graphs), \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IText}{iText} for creating
      PDF reports, \href{http://www.stringtemplate.org/}{StringTemplate}, JDBC.
    \item designed and developed the authentication / authorization database and implemented all back-end Java
      code to integrate Apache Shiro into our JSF pages and deliver an elaborate RBAC authentication solution
      for all GAIA applications.\\
      \technologies{} \href{http://shiro.apache.org/}{Apache Shiro}, PostgreSQL, JDBC.
