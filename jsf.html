  <li>pattern for JSF / EJB3 with extended transaction context</li>
  The following is a pattern that seems to avoid detached contexts
  and other JPA-problems.<p>
    Each JSF view is backed by a <b>ViewScoped</b> or <b>RequestScoped</b>
    backing bean. That backing bean accesses (by means of the <b>ManagedProperty</b>
    annotation) a session-scoped JSF-managed bean. The session-scoped JSF-managed
    bean then injects (by means of an <b>@EJB</b> annotation) a <b>stateful EJB3</b>
    bean. This stateful EJB3 bean then injects an <b>EntityManager</b> with
    an extended persistence context (to avoid detachment of the web layer).
    We call that stateful EJB3 bean the <i>service</i>. The <i>service</i>
    actually is a DAO and handles all communication with the database through
    the single injected <b>EntityManager</b> (whether for one or more than
    one tables).<p>
    The basic motivation for this pattern (apart from the extended transaction
    context which was done to avoid detachment in the web layer), is that
    when separate different <b>EntityManagers</b> are injected in the various facades
    the problem arises that these EntityManagers are in fact different and keep
    different caches, also, an object created on one EntityManager cannot be merged
    in a second (again due to the multiple independent EntityManagers that have
    been injected).<p>
    There are two variations of the above pattern solely for organizational purposes:
    <ol>
      <li>one is to group the various table-specific methods and their implementations
        in facade-like DAO POJOs. The <i>service</i> EJB3 bean then simply contains
        dispatchers that rely to the implementations. The only benefit that that
        brings is to avoid having all the implementations in the same place.
      </li>
      <li>a more radical variation is to actually implement the various table DAO facades
        as proper, stateful EJB3 beans and have them injected in the <i>service</i> EJB3
        bean. In this patter, the <i>service</i> EJB3 bean acts simply as a place to inject
        all other EJB3 facades. The JSF-backing beans call a getFacade() method whose implementation
        ultimately relays to the <i>service</i> EJB3 bean before then can get the actual
        facades. This only works because, for some magical reason, we noticed that in this case
        the underlying, delegate, EntityManager object for all facades injected in the <i>service</i> EJB3 bean <u>are the same</u>. Therefore it is a more elegent variation than the variation above
        but it is also more magical and less clearly understood. It is more elegant because
        we no longer have to implement relaying methods in the EJB3 <i>service</i> bean and there
        exist actual DAO facades for all the various tables.

      <li>backing-bean / JavaScript communication</li>
      The way to implement backing bean / JavaScript communication is demonstrated in
      this <a href="fileset-00/List.xhtml">view</a> and <a href="fileset-00/CustomerLController.java">backing bean</a> pair.
      <p>
        Examine constructs <b><i>focusSurname</i></b>,  <b><i>p:ajax event="keyup"</i></b> and <b><i>script</i></b>.
        <p>
          Another way is to hardcode in the <b><i>script</b></i> definition in the .xhtml page access to the backing-beans properties
          using EL and at runtime, these are replaced by the actual values in the client-side code.
          <li>extending <b>xhtml</b> views</li>
          Using the:<b>&ltC:Choose&gt</b> tag it is possible to customize and extend
          an automatically generated xhtml view by introducing your own parts.
          The pattern is (refer to the html source for proper formatting cause
          I don't have the time to format it for html right now):
          <pre>
&ltC:Choose&gt &gtcall on a backingBean method to select case at runtime&lt
[case 1: default]
... automatically generated ..
[case 2: hook for programmer]
inclusion of an external <b>xhtml</b> file which
is the one that the programmer modifies
&lt/C:Choose&gt
          </pre>
          The benefit of the above pattern is that the totality of the xhtml view
          can be overwritten every time it is re-generated and the programmer will
          only modify the external (imported) xhtml file and will also overwrite
          the backing-bean's selector method to select case 2. NRL has an optinal
          annotation that allows that kind of code to be generated for a particular
          component, otherwise no extension facility is emmited (so if a programmer
          is not satisfied with the default emmission he has to modify the NRL and
          re-generate so that the extension facility is emmited).
          <li>modal pop-ups in JSF and Ajax</li>
          The modality of pop-ups in <b>JSF</b> can be arranged by virtue
          of a <i>'modal'</i> property. However, there appears to be a bug
          and one has to also specify <i>'process=this'</i>. This is strange
          as in the normal case of a modal dialog prompting for a
          'yes'/'no' answer, the <i>'this'</i> doesn't carry any data to
          the server side. I.e. the post only indicates (presumably)
          the <i>actionListener</i> to be called but it doesn't update
          any fields in the backing bean.
          <li>ViewStateExpiredException and JSF saving state</li>
          <i>ViewStateExpiredExceptions</i> can be alleviated with the use
          of JSF client-side state saving.
          <li>state saving methods and compression</li>
          In Mojarra (circa 2012) either used state saving to 'server', or,
          if set to client, disable compression, i.e. do a:<p/>
          &ltcontext-param&gt<p/>
          &ltparam-name&gtjavax.faces.STATE_SAVING_METHOD&lt/param-name&gt<p/>
          &ltparam-value&gtclient&lt/param-value&gt<p/>
          &lt/context-param&gt<p/>
          &ltcontext-param&gt<p/>
          &ltparam-name&gtcom.sun.faces.compressViewState&lt/param-name&gt<p/>
          &ltparam-value&gttrue&lt/param-value&gt<p/>
          &lt/context-param&gt
          <li>difference between 'rendered' and 'visible'</li>
          <b>rendered</b> is server-side whereas <b>visible</b> is client-side.
          <li>how to include the root context in an <b>href</b></li>
          There are at least two ways (view source if you can't see this):
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h:outputLink value="#{facesContext.externalContext.requestContextPath}/GetAllUsers">Get all users</h:outputLink>
              <li>
                <a href="#{request.contextPath}/cacher/ehcache.xhtml">Cache Area</a>
          </ul>

</ol>
