On the issue of VMWare networking ttsiodras told me that there are
three modes of operation for a VMWare machine: (1) host, (2) bridged
and (3) NAT.
** Mode 1 (host) is like a twisted pair cable between the host and the VMWare
machine in question. No broader network is visible from the VMWare machine.
** Mode 2 (bridged) is the default and corresponds to the VMWare machine
being on the same broadcast segment as the host (e.g. same Ethernet 
segment or same wireless hotspot). In this mode (and perhaps in others too)
the VMWare player itself acts as a DHCP server and allocates an IP address
to the VMWare machine, on startup. The debian itself (or, in general,
the operating system running in the virtual machine) has no concept that
it's being run "inside" a virtual machine and so simply broadcasts a
DHCP request on its MAC, since the VMWare Player's DHCP is the first DHCP
to answer (being "closer") it obtains an IP from that deamon.
** Mode 3 (NAT) corresponds to the host machine acting as a NAT front-end
(providing forward and reverse lookup) for the virtual machine being 
played.
