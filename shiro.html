<li>how to share sessions in Shiro</li>

Yes, this is one option that works ok on apps running on the same
physical host.  If you have apps across hosts, you'll need to enable a
clustered cache (like adding TerraCotta to support Ehcache) so the
same session data is accessible across multiple hosts (this might be
smart even with apps on a single host to provide an additional level
of guarantee for cache coherency).

Or you can create a SessionDAO to use whatever shared data store you
like (e.g. RDBMS or NoSQL data store like Cassandra or Mongo).  Just
configure the same SessionDAO in each Shiro-enabled app, and it should
be fine.
