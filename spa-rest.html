      in my playground that shows how to deploy a simple React-based SPA application against a REST backend.
      This particular example is somewhat complicated as it additionally showcases a second presentation-oriented application (using JSP) that works together with the React-based SPA.
      </p>
      <p>So, in total there are three applications working in tandem:
        <ul>
          <li>a service-oriented REST-based (JAX-RS) application</li>
          <li>a presentation-oriented React-based application</li>
          <li>a presentation-oriented JSP application</li>          
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Due to the considerations involved in making three different applications work together, this example also shows
      how to set up <b>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)</b>.</p>
    </ol>
