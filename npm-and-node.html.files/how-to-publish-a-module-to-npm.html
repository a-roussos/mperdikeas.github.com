      Examples of two npm modules I've successfully published and used using the above guides:
      <ul>
        <li><a href='https://github.com/mperdikeas/js-object-properties'>js-object-properties</a></li>
        <li><a href='https://github.com/mperdikeas/faker-datastore'>faker-datastore</a></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>gotchas</h3>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
          If you follow the structure of my modules mentioned above be sure to change the <code>main</code> attribute in <code>package.json</code> from:<br/><br/>
            <code>"index.js"</code>
            <br/><br/>&hellip; to:<br/><br/>
            <code>"lib/index.js"</code>
          </p>
          <p>Failure to do so will result in "cannot find package" messages
            when the module is required.</p>
        </li>
        <li>to be able to perform the test regarding the local-global installation you'd have to first setup <tt>Node</tt> to search that location as well (see <a href='../npm-and-node.html#node-local-global'>this note</a>).</li>
        <li id='local-global-testing'>Before you publish to <b>npm</b> you should test your package by means of publishing locally
          and then requiring it from another directory (from the REPL). This is explained in the guide
          linked above and the local global installation command is correctly given as:
          <pre>
npm install . -g
          </pre>
          <p>
            However, after the initial local global installation you will invariably encounter bugs that you will have to
            fix (locally again). After each fix you should do (from the root of your project):
            <pre>
npm run build && npm install . -g
            </pre>
          </p>
          <p>
            During these (local) iterations (that don't get published to the public <b>npm</b> repository) you
            don't need to update the version in <tt>package.json</tt>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To test, simply <tt>cd</tt> to some other dir, open a repl (<tt>node</tt> or <tt>nodejs</tt>)
            and <tt>require</tt> your package to test its newly added functionality.
          </p>
          <p><b>NB:</b> I have encountered cases where even though the module was locally installed in the
            global location, it was still not visible and I had to do an additional <tt>npm link</tt>.
            See <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/q/38188087/274677'>this SO question of mine</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end of a number of such iterations you are now able to publish to <b>npm</b>.
            Before you do that however, remember to update the version in <tt>package.json</tt>
            respecting <a href='http://semver.org/'>semver</a>.<br/>
            Once this is done do:
            <pre>
npm publish
            </pre>
          </p>
          <p>
            However, even if you do forget to update <tt>package.json</tt> <b>npm</b> will baulk with an informative
            message, so no worries there.
          </p>

          <p>
            Afterwards, you are able to install your package from everywhere by name (rather than, e.g. having to
            point at a Github URL):
            <pre>
npm install &lt;your-package-name&gt;
            </pre>
          </p>
          You may also have to do a:
          <pre>
npm update -g &lt;your-package-name&gt;
          </pre>
          &hellip; to ensure that your package has been updated in the global (local) repository (though if you've already
          installed it locally with <code>npm install . -g</code> you may not see any difference. At any rate you can
          use the following command to find the locally available version of your package:
          <pre>
npm ls -g | grep &lt;your-package-name&gt;
          </pre>
          <p>               
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
          The interplay between the two ignore files:
          <ul>
            <li><code>.gitignore</code></li>
            <li><code>.npmignore</code></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        &hellip; is terribly important as it can break your module and prevent clients from successfully requiring it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both files need to be present as different sets of files should be ignored by <strong>git</strong> and
          <strong>npm</strong>. For instance:
          <ul>
            <li>The <tt>src/</tt> directory should be ignored by <strong>npm</strong> but included by <strong>git</strong></li>
            <li>The <tt>lib/</tt> directory should be ignored by <strong>git</strong> but included by <strong>npm</strong></li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          A typical erroneous case I encountered during <a href='#local-global-testing'>local global testing</a> was that the
          <tt>lib/</tt> directory in the local global publishing location included only the <tt>index.js</tt> file but
          not an <tt>app.js</tt> it required.
          I assume the <tt>lib/index.js</tt> file was included because it is explicitly identified in <tt>package.json</tt>:
          <pre>
$ cat package.json | grep main
  "main": "lib/index.js",
          </pre>
          As a result, I had this situation:
          <pre>
$ ls /home/mperdikeas/.node_modules_global/lib/node_modules/filtered-datastore/lib/
total 12
drwxrwxr-x 2 mperdikeas mperdikeas 4096 Jun 13 12:08 ./
drwxrwxr-x 6 mperdikeas mperdikeas 4096 Jun 13 12:08 ../
-rw-rw-r-- 1 mperdikeas mperdikeas  113 Jun 13 12:08 index.js
          </pre>
        </p>
        &hellip; whereas when I properly added a <tt>.npmignore</tt> file I got (after the next <code>npm install . -g</code>) the
        following situation:
        <pre>
$ ls /home/mperdikeas/.node_modules_global/lib/node_modules/filtered-datastore/lib/
total 24
drwxrwxr-x 2 mperdikeas mperdikeas 4096 Jun 13 12:16 ./
drwxrwxr-x 5 mperdikeas mperdikeas 4096 Jun 13 12:16 ../
-rw-rw-r-- 1 mperdikeas mperdikeas 3739 Jun 13 12:15 app.js
-rw-rw-r-- 1 mperdikeas mperdikeas 3551 Jun 13 12:15 app.js.map
-rw-rw-r-- 1 mperdikeas mperdikeas  113 Jun 13 12:15 index.js
-rw-rw-r-- 1 mperdikeas mperdikeas  229 Jun 13 12:15 index.js.map
        </pre>
        <p>
          Refer to my <a href='https://github.com/mperdikeas/js-filtered-datastore'>filtered datastore</a>
          module for correct <code>.npmignore</code> and <code>.gitignore</code> files.
