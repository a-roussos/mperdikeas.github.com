<li>Configuring JBoss 7 AS HTTP port</li>
you need to modify the following file (in standalone mode):
<i>/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml</i>
<p>
Take note that this file allows you to set both the port and the IP address bindings.
By default JBoss 7 AS is bound to 127.0.0.1 but you can set this to another address
or even to 0.0.0.0 (which binds to all interfaces).
