<li>Configuring JBoss 7 AS HTTP port</li>
you need to modify the following file (in standalone mode):
<i>/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml</i>
<p>
Take note that this file allows you to set both the port and the IP address bindings.
By default JBoss 7 AS is bound to 127.0.0.1 but you can set this to another address
or even to 0.0.0.0 (which binds to all interfaces).
</ol>

The important section in the above configuration file is the following:
<pre>
<interfaces>                                                                                                            
    <interface name="management">                                                                                       
        <inet-address value="${jboss.bind.address.management:127.0.0.1}"/>                                              
    </interface>                                                                                                        
    <interface name="public">                                                                                           
        <inet-address value="${jboss.bind.address:127.0.0.1}"/>                                                         
    </interface>                                                                                                        
        <interface name="unsecure">                                                                                         
        <inet-address value="${jboss.bind.address.unsecure:127.0.0.1}"/>                                                
    </interface>                                                                                                        
</interfaces>       
</pre>
The various bindings can be enforced (in place of the default 127.0.0.1 values) by defining environment parameters
upon the invocation of the "/bin/standalone.sh" script. E.g. I've defined a script "jboss-start" as follows:
<pre>
    ./standalone.sh -Djboss.bind.address=192.168.2.5 -bmanagement=127.0.0.1
</pre>
This allows me to connect to the deployed wars from remote machines and use the jboss_cli.sh console only locally.
