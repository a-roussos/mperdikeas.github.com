***   2012.01.30   ***   apt package manager
apt-get update (to update packages - totally passive)
apt-cache search [word] (to find packages whose description contains the word 'word')
apt-get install [foo] (to install package foo and all its dependencies)

to see all installed packages:
dpkg -l

sometimes, esp. in Debian which is very conservative packages may not be available with apt so they are installed as alternatives and are visible with:

update-alternatives --list java
