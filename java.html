<li>Monitor a running JVM</li>
Use the <b>jvisualvm</b> Oracle program to attach to a running instance of the
JVM and display various graphs. See below a possible use that tries to attach
to the JBoss process (running in [s]tandal[one] mode):
<pre>
jvisualvm --openpid $(ps aux | grep java | grep tandal | awk '{print $2}'
</pre>
<li>JBoss Application Server configuration directory</li>
This comes handy for storing JBoss-specific configuration parameters
that cannot be part of an EAR:
<pre>
String serverConfUrl = System.getProperty("jboss.server.config.dir") ;
</pre>
<li>UTF8 encoding in Java</li>
In general problems may occur both in the compile stage (javac) and in the
execution stage (java). The following flags are pertinent:
<pre>
javac -encoding utf-8 X.java // or utf8, UTF-8, UTF8
java -Dfile.encoding=UTF8 X
</pre>
Even the two settings above may not solve the problem if the
font used by the terminal doesn't contain a rendering for a
particular character (e.g. the 0x0222 character in the example 
below).
<pre>
public class X {
    public static void main (String args[]) {
        System.out.println("\u0222");
    }
}
</pre>

Also, the file.encoding trick may be ok for a small console program
but maybe not with a server. You may want to use a special
PrintStream instead. That is because the JVM runtime
does attempt to find out what
character encoding the environment outside the JVM uses, and
apparently in your environment it gets a native character set
of something else that UTF8.

So, even if you have funky UTF-8 characters in your source,
Java may be able to print them out in environments with some
other native character encoding, if that other encoding
happens to have a code point for the same character glyph.

For example, source code with UTF-8 may contain the byte
sequence [0xc3, 0xa4], signifying lower-case a-diaeresis
character glyph. Now, if that source code is compiled
properly, letting the compiler know that the source is in UTF-8
character set, and subsequently the code is run in an environment
with ISO-8859-1 character set, the program will output just
one byte, 0xE4. Also, if the same code is run in an environment
configured for plain US-ASCII character set, it will output
only a question mark (as US-ASCII character set does not have
a glyph for the a-diaeresis character).

<li>error:unmappable character for encoding Cp1252</li>
This is a problem that plagues Windows OS when
compiling Java sources.
Setting the following environment properties fixed
the problem in one occassion:
<pre>
ANT_OPTS
-Dfile.encoding=UTF8

JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS
-Dfile.encoding=UTF8
</pre>

<li>useful bash scriplet to generate Java classpath</li>
Often a number of jars are located inside a given folder
(folder 'repo-wide-libs' in the example below). To construct
a Java classpath that will include them all, do a:
<pre>echo repo-wide-libs/*jar | sed 's, ,:,g'</pre>
Alternatively one can use <b>tr</b> instead of <b>sed</b>:
<pre>java -cp $(echo lib/*.jar | tr ' ' ':') ..</pre>
<li>how to solve '<i>unmappable character<i>' problems in '<i>javac<i>'</li>
The problem is usually solved by adding the following line in the &lt<b>javac</b>&gt
Ant task invocation:
<pre>
&ltcompilerarg line="-encoding utf-8"/&gt
</pre>
(see examplary java-se build.xml in archetypes/ant)<p>
On some occassions I've also used:
<pre>
&ltcompilerarg line="-encoding ISO-8859-1"/&gt
</pre>
<li>install Oracle Java in Ubuntu</li>
(<href="http://www.webupd8.org/2012/01/install-oracle-java-jdk-7-in-ubuntu-via.html">source</href>)To install the latest Oracle Java 7 in Ubuntu (supports Ubuntu 12.04, 11.10, 11.04 and 10.04), use the commands below:
<pre>
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer
</pre>

After the installation finishes, if you wish to see if it was successful, you can run the following command:

<pre>java -version</pre>

It should return something like this:

java version "1.7.0_04"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_04-b20)
Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM (build 23.0-b21, mixed mode)
