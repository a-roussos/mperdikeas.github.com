    <h1>How I installed <a href='http://www.graphviz.org/'>Graphviz</a> on Ubuntu 16.04</h1>
    <p>
      I started by downloading a single <tt>deb</tt> file
      from <a href='http://www.graphviz.org/Download_linux_ubuntu.php'>this
      page</a> that was apparently intended for Ubuntu 13.10.
    </p>
    <p>
      The file's name was <tt>graphviz_2.38.0-1-saucy_amd64.deb</tt>
    </p>
    <p>I then started with a typical <code>dpkg -i</code> command and
      the installed the dependencies using <code>apt-get install -f</code>
      as advised <a href='http://askubuntu.com/a/40050/89663'>here</a>. The process was not uneventful and I had to go back and forth a couple of times. In addition, I also issued a couple of more explicit commands. Here are the commands from my history
      <pre>
 5283  sudo dpkg -i /home/mperdikeas/Downloads/graphviz_2.38.0-1-saucy_amd64.deb
 5284  sudo apt-get -f install
 5285*
 5286  sudo apt-get -f install
 5287  sudo dpkg -i /home/mperdikeas/Downloads/graphviz_2.38.0-1-saucy_amd64.deb
 5288  sudo apt-get install freeglut3
 5289  sudo apt-get -f install freeglut3
 5290  sudo apt-get -f install graphviz
 </pre>
    </p>
    <p>And below is the full trace:
