    <ol>
      <li>Require little, or no money, avoiding the need for outside investors (i.e you can bootstrap).</li>
      <li>Is simple to explain, but hard to conceive. For those of you who have a biology background PCR is the classic example of this.</li>
      <li>Is not being worked on by anyone else (i.e. no direct competitors).</li>
      <li>Easy for customers to trial and use (i.e. low barriers to selling).</li>
      <li>Fits into an existing market so you don&#39;t have to create both a new product and a new market at the same time.</li>
      <li>Is not dependent of the actions of others (e.g. does not build on Twitter&#39;s API).</li>
      <li>Has no legal issues --- don&#39;t want to spend the next 20 years in litigation with everyone.</li>
      <li>Cannot be easily replicated.</li>
      <li>The first mover has a major advantage.</li>
      <li>Is a natural monopoly that can be defended. Ideas that have a strong network effect are often natural monopolies.</li>
      <li>Has a high R0 index (i.e. is viral).</li>
      <li>Offers high margins that won&#39;t be eroded over time.</li>
      <li>Solves an interesting and/or important problem that will make your mother proud (i.e. make a dent in the world).</li>
      <li>Provides your customers with such significant value that they will wonder how they once lived without it.</li>
      <li>Is sticky --- customers won&#39;t switch to other products. Ideas that have a strong network effect are sticky.</li>
      <li>Is 100x better than any current product or service.</li>
      <li>Can be sold without expensive sales staff (i.e. low touch sales model).</li>
      <li>Can be adapted to be used in other markets (i.e. build narrow and expand later).</li>
      <li>Generates sufficient cashflow to enable your company to expand as fast as you want without needing external investors.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#39;t threaten any well-established powers who are able and willing to crush you.</li>
      <li>Is of interest to the media (free PR).</li>
      <li>Has a narrow target market that can be identified and reached.</li>
      <li>Is not dependent on the use of low cost labour.</li>
      <li>Can be scaled to support millions of users at a low cost.</li>
      <li>Can be sold internationally.</li>
    </ol>
