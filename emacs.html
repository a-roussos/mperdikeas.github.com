        <li>solve the dreaded <code>C-SPACE</code> sequence key not working in emacs</li>
        <p><i>I was beset by this problem when I installed Emacs24 on Ubuntu 14.04.5 on the Dell Precision
          laptop (August '16)
        </i></p>
        <p>Basically what happens is that the <code>C-SPACE</code> combo is hijacked by the <code>ibus</code> program and not recognized as a sequence in Emacs. When you <tt>ssh</tt> to the computer from another
          machine that doesn't suffer from this problem the combo works as expected (this proves that the problem
          is not in Emacs but rather in the desktop environment).

        <p>Follow <a href='http://askubuntu.com/q/243639'>these instructions</a>.</p>
        <p>Core of the solution:
          <quote>
            <p>In 14.04, you can edit the settings directly is <code>dconf-editor</code>.</p>
            <p>If it is not installed:
              <pre>sudo apt install dconf-editor</pre>
            </p>
            <p>
              Then browse to Desktop >> ibus >> general >> hotkey. The trigger and triggers setting will still show 'control+space'. Edit these settings out, being careful to leave empty brackets [] in triggers.

        <li>solve the dreaded <code>M-<RET></code> problem in Org-mode on tty</li>
          Use <a href="http://orgmode.org/manual/TTY-keys.html#TTY-keys">these alternative key bindings</a>
          as suggested in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/6808124/274677">this answer</a>.
          <li>how to disable ALT key hijacking in Unity when working with Emacs</li>
          Follow <a href="http://askubuntu.com/a/455531">these instructions</a>.
          <p>
            Basically install <code>ccsm</code> (CompizConfig Settings Manager):
            <pre>
sudo apt-get install CompizConfig-Settings-Manager.
            </pre>
            &hellip; then run <code>ccsm</code> and select Desktop / Ubuntu Unity Plugin and disable the "Key to show the menu bar while pressed" and possibly "Key to show the HUD when tapped" too.
          </p>
          <p>
            Basically disable everything bound to the <code>ALT</code> key to be on the safe side.

          <li>how to load a module in Emacs and associate it with a file extension</li>
          It is a three-step process:
          <ol>
            <li>extend the <tt>load-path</tt> to include the directory where the <tt>*.el</tt> file for the mode lives</li>
            <li>load the module</li>
            <li>associate the module with the file extension</li>
          </ol>
          This is nicely shown in the below excrept from my <tt>.emacs</tt> file:
          <pre>
(progn
    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/web-mode/")
    (load "web-mode")
    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.html\\'" . web-mode))
)
          </pre>
          It is advisable that that the <tt>el</tt> file lives in a <a href="git.html#submodules">git submodule</a>.
          <li>how to view the value of a variable in Emacs</li>
          Use the function <code>describe-variable</code> (usually bound to <tt>C-h v</tt>)
          <li>replace tabs / spaces in Emacs</li>
          The way to do it is via <b>M-x tabify</b> or <b>M-x untabify</b>.
          These functions work on the current selection, so to apply them to
          the whole buffer do a <b>C-x h</b> beforehand.

              and had Emacs 24 installed.

            <p>
              (which points you to:

              )
            </p>
            <p>
              but it didn't work. The reason was that I was being silly because the link at http:emacs.naquadah.org ALSO points to Damien Cassou's page (it says: "If you are looking for the Ubuntu packages, Damien Cassou now maintains an emacs-snapshot PPA.") but I was tired and my eyes were sore and didn't notice it.
