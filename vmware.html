<li>VMWare Player virtual machine network settings</li>
There are three modes:
    <ul>
    <li>host-only:</li>
        in which case it is only visible by the host operating system
        and not any other node in the network
    <li>reverse NAT</li>
    <li>bridged:</li>
        which is by far the most realistic. Any VMWare virtual machine
        you configure using the <i>bridged</i> option is exactly the
        same as another physical machine on the LAN segment (a.k.a the 
        broadcast domain). These physical machines, even have MAC 
        addresses and you could configure an <b>DHCP</b> server 
        to even assign them specific IP addresses based on these MACs.
        There are totally indistinguishable from other real machines
        connected on the LAN segment. The name 'bridged' alludes to the
        fact that VMWare implements something akin to a bridge functionality
        in that it copies packets on the MAC layer.
<li>VMWare Player interfaces</li>
    Upon installing VMWare Player one will notice (with <b>ifconfig</b>)
    two new interfaces: <b>vmnet1</b> and <b>vmnet8</b>. These are unrelated
    to any virtual machines created, they come with the installation of VMWare
    Player. Actually, if you only create virtual machines of the "bridged" type
    (see above) you'll never use any of these interfaces, as a "bridged" virtual
    machine has its own, 'real' interface which you can't see of course by doing
    an <b>ifconfig</b> at the host operating system.
