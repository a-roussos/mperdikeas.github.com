<li>how to change a file's encoding from ISO8859-7 to UTF8</li>
It may happen that the <b>javac</b> compiler complains for the encoding
used in a file. Rather than using the -encoding option to <b>javac</b>
(in the build.xml, use &ltpresetdef&gt to setup defaults for all of your <b>javac</b> invocations and pass -Dfile.encoding=iso-8859-7)
one can also convert the file manually.
<p>To find the offending file:
<pre>
 $ ant  2>&1 | grep unmapp | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's,:.*,,' | sort | uniq
</pre>
convert it with iconv:
<pre>
iconv -f ISO8859-7 -t UTF-8 
</pre>
(you may also have to export LANG=en_US.UTF-8)
<li>piping with xargs</li>
To rm all java files (you need the -print0 and -0 options to work with filenames containing spaces etc.):
<pre>find . -iname \*.txt -print0 | xargs -0 rm</pre>
<li>recursively copy with permissions</li>
<pre>cp -pr</pre>
<li>pipe coloured output through less</li>
Use the 'ls -RG' option and make sure the original application (that
generates the colour-coded output) is set to --color=always if such option
exists.
<li>find the package a binary belongs to in Debian distros</li>
<p>E.g. find the package for <i>sensors</i>:
<pre>
dpkg -S $(which sensors)
</pre>
<li>monitor chipset and CPU sensors in Ubuntu</li>
Use <b>sensors</b> from package <i>lm-sensors</i> as in:
<pre>
watch sensors
</pre>
<li>change hostname in Ubuntu</li>
simply edit /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts (for 127.0.0.1). To flush the previous hostname
from various applications a reboot may be required.

<li>setting HTTP proxy in Ubuntu</li>
<pre>
export http_proxy="http://foo.bar:8080"
</pre>
subsequent wget requests will redirect to foo.bar:8080
<li>package managers</li>
apt is used in Debian, Ubuntu and rpm in Fedora, Redhat, Suse. apt is better.<p>
Typical <b>apt</b> commands: apt-get install, apt-cache search, apt-get autoremove, apt-get update.
<li>curl</li>
curl is a Linux utility that can be used to simulate HTTP GET and HTTP POST requests.
A simple:<pre>#curl www.in.gr</pre> ...will execute an HTTP GET against www.in.gr.
<li>SSE time</li>
get time in SSE:<pre>date +%s</pre>
<li>Linux print system information</li>
including kernel 32 or 64 bit:<pre>uname -a</pre>
x86_64 GNU/Linux indicates that you've a 64bit Linux kernel running.
If you use see i386/i486/i586/i686 it is a 32 bit kernel.
<li>Find if CPU is 32 or 64 bits</li>
<pre>grep flags /proc/cpuinfo | grep lm </pre></br> ("lm" means long mode CPU - 64 bit CPU)
<li>find installed packages</li>
<pre>
apt-cache search <search-string> - or -
dpkg --get-selections | grep <search-string>
</pre>
<li>install packages</li>
<pre>apt-get install <package-name></pre>
<li>how to find a file named "compile_decoder.sh" in a set of bz2 files</li>
<pre>for f in `ls *.bz2` ; do tar -jtvf  $f ; done | grep compile_decoder.sh</pre>
</br>
... Actually, the following also works and produces identical output:
<pre>for f in `ls *.bz2` ; do tar -jtvf $f | grep compile_decoder.sh ; done</pre>
<li>to find out the release</li>
<pre>$ lsb_release -a</pre>

2012-03-05: in order to create a bootable USB drive from an ISO image it
                is not possible to use dd and perform a binary data copy.
                Special magic has to be used. Ttsiodras sent me a folder
                with the necessary magic. Bottom line is that the files
                in the ISO image are actually copied and that special bits
                are set in the flash drive's filesystem to denote the
                partition as bootable. See folder CreateUSBstickFromISO.
                However I was not able to make it work; the USB flash
                drive was formated and created but I wasn't ablt to 
                boot it. In the end I just burned a CD. BTW the following
                page:
                http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/download
                created detailed instructions on how to create a USB
                flash drive and suggests another solution ("Pen Drive
                Linux's USB Installer").

                There is also another option which is to create a Live Linux
                USB stick or even a persistent one (with the ability to
                save files, install programs and so on). This option is
                possible using the "LinuxLive USB Creator 2.8.10.exe"
                program.

2012-03-06: to find the Linux distro:

2012-03-14: how to display recursive size of folders (i.e. including
                contents):
                sudo du - s -m *

                directory file).

2012-03-15: how to find in which package a binary belongs,
            e.g. the lsb_release binary:
            dpkg -S $(which lsb_release)
2012-03-15: how to show the versions of debian apt packages:
            use the apt_show_versions utility
2012-03-15: the /etc/apt/sources.list file is not directly related to the 
            operations of the:
                apt-get dist-upgrade command
            the dist-upgrade command always stays in the same Debian version
            but implements the progression: stable->testing->unstable.
            So, for instance from the stable phase it takes two invocations
            of the dist-upgrade to reach the unstable phase; from the
            testing phase only one. And you can't go backwards.
            The /etc/apt/sources.list file "simply" provides the URL of
            the repositories for each version.
