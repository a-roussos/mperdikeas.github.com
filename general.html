<li>how to install <b>Conkeror</b> in Ubuntu (again, latest approach)</li>
On 15.IX.2014 I used the following approach to install <b>Conkeror</b>:
The source was <a href="http://superuser.com/a/434242/138891">this answer</a>
<ol>
<li>install the apt repository for Nightly built Conkeror Debian Pakcages</li>
<a href="http://noone.org/conkeror-nightly-debs/">source</a>
<br/>
Add the following lines to your /etc/apt/sources.list (for Wheezy as in my system
that's what <code>cat /etc/debian_version</code> shows):
<pre>
deb     http://noone.org/conkeror-nightly-debs wheezy main
deb-src http://noone.org/conkeror-nightly-debs wheezy main
</pre>
<br/>
Then add the latest key to your APT key ring without verfication, just execute the following as root:
<br/>
<pre>
apt-key adv --keyserver pgp.uni-mainz.de --recv-keys 0F84088E
</pre>
<li>Install the conkeror packages</li>
<a href="http://conkeror.org/InstallationDebian#Ubuntu_Lucid_and_Maverick">source</a>
<pre>
sudo apt-get udpate
sudo apt-get install conkeror conkeror-spawn-process-helper
</pre>
<li>finally, rely on the (already existing by now) <i>conkeror</i> script and Dash integration
using <b>alacarte</b> as described in the alternative instructions (used in the past)
<a href="#how-to-install-conkeror-a">below</a>
</ol>
<li>convert PDF to PNG high-quality</li>
The below seems to give good results (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/6605006/274677">source</a>):
<pre>
convert -density 300 cds-oai-dc-problem.pdf -trim -quality 100  cds-oai-dc-problem.png
</pre>
By passing <b>-trim</b> as an option we also get rid of a subsequent trimming step.
<li>command line to convert a PDF file to PNG in Ubuntu</li>
<pre>
convert database-high-level.pdf -background White -flatten database-high-level.png
</pre>
(the above incantation also replaces the transparent background with white background)
<li>trim PNG images in Ubuntu</li>
Use the <b>trim</b> command of the <b>convert</b> program from the <b>ImageMagick</b> package:
<pre>
convert input.png -trim output.png
</pre>
<li>meld alternative (that also supports comparisons among more than 2 files)</li>
<pre>sudo apt-get install diffuse</pre>
<li>install DbVisualizer 9.1 in Ubuntu</li>
In the past I had some successes with the <i>Linux x86 setup installer</i> you can get
from <a href="http://www.dbvis.com/download/">here</a>, but today I failed repeatedly to
get it to properly install using that script, so in the end I just downloaded the UNIX tar.gz
archive (from the same location), exploded it locally and then added <b>dbvis</b> on the 
launchpad Dash using <a href="https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/alacarte/">alacarte</a>.
I then searched my gmail for the <b>dbvis.license</b> key I have.
<li>add an arbitrary application to the Ubuntu Dash overlay of the launchpad</li>
Use <b>alacarte</b>. Info <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/67753/how-do-i-add-an-application-to-the-dash">here</a>.
<li>compare files in current directory only with those of another directory</li>
<b>way 1</b><br/>
The below way uses the <i>snapshot_dir</i> as the reference directory, so if a file is missing there it is not compared.
<pre>
    for f in $(find snapshot_dir -maxdepth 1 -type f -iname \*.xsd -o -iname \*.dtd) ; do diff `basename $f` $f ; done
</pre>
<br/>
<b>way 2</b><br/>
The below way uses the <i>local_dir</i> as the reference directory, so if a file is missing there is is not compared.
<pre>
    for f in $(find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -iname \*.xsd -o -iname \*.dtd) ; do diff $f snapshot_dir/$f ; done
</pre>
I suppose the most rigorous check is combining both ways in a single script.

</li>
Original link <a href="http://www.conkeror.org/InstallationUnix">here</a>.
Four steps:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>instal <b>xulrunner</b></li>
    </p>follow top answer <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/125980/how-do-i-install-xulrunner-in-12-04">here</a>.
    </p>Note that for some reason the <b><i>sudo sh -c "wget -O- $XURL | tar -xj"</i></b> command didn't
        work for me and I had to manually download <b>$XURL</b> (in my case it was
        <a href="https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/releases/23.0/runtimes/xulrunner-23.0.en-US.linux-i686.tar.bz2">this link</a>), and then do a:
        </p><pre>sudo cat ~/Downloads/xulrunner-23.0.en-US.linux-i686.tar.bz2 | sudo tar -xj</pre>
    <li>install <b>Conkeror</b></li>
    For that, I didn't follow my earlier routine (described <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/434228/installing-conkeror-on-ubuntu-12-04">here</a>), but rather I simply cloned Conkeror's git repository:
     <pre>git clone http://repo.or.cz/r/conkeror.git</pre> 
    <li>preapare a <b>conkeror</b> script</li>
    In my case, that script I prepared (based on instructions found <a href="http://www.conkeror.org/InstallationUnix">here</a> resides in the <b>~tools</b> git repository.
    <li>add the script to the Dash using <b>alacarte</b></li>
    Instructions <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/67753/how-do-i-add-an-application-to-the-dash">here<a/>.

<li>how to open up a terminal in any folder of the file browser</li>
<pre>sudo apt-get install nautilus-open-terminal</pre>
</p>then, right-clicking on a folder shows option "Open in Terminal" (a log-off / log-in cycle
may be necessary)
<li>how to install <b>bd</b> (quickly go back to a specfic parent directory)</li>
Original link: <a href="https://github.com/vigneshwaranr/bd">here</a>.
</p>
(I 've downloaded it at ~/tools, so I it's not on /usr/bin/bd)
<li>get diff (esp. a recursive one) to produce <b>very</b> summarized output</li>
Pipe the output of diff to <b>diffstat</b>
<li>find out quickly the amount of memory recognized by the system</li>
<pre>free -mt</pre>
<li>find out if the Linux version and/or the hardware support PAE (Physical Address Extension)</li>
This is determined by searching for the string 'pae' in the output of the following
programs, for the OS and the hardware, respectively:
<pre>uname -a | grep pae</pre>
<pre>grep --color=always -i PAE /proc/cpuinfo</pre>
<li>show system specs in Ubuntu</li>
There are many ways:
<pre>sudo lshw</pre>
<pre>sudo lshw -html > myspecs.html</pre>
<pre>sysinfo</pre>
<pre>htop</pre>
<li>how to find which process binds on specific ports</li>
<pre>sudo netstat -tulpn </pre>
and then, once you have the PID (e.g. 3903), you can do a:
    <pre>
        ls -l /proc/3903/exe
        cat /proc/3903/cmdline
        ls -l /proc/3903/cwd </pre>
    ... to find more about the process.
<li>pattern to use when in need to replace broken links in a systematic way:</li>
<pre>
find . -iname \*.jar | while read ANS;
    do DIR=$(dirname "$ANS");
    cd "$DIR";
    rm $(basename "$ANS"); 
    ln -s ../../../../../../../../repo-wide-libs/$(basename "$ANS");
done
</pre>
<li>interesting tar incantation</li>
<pre>tar jcpf archive-name.tar.bz2 www/{folderA,folderB} </pre>
<li>report total disk usage of directory</li>
<pre>du -s</pre>
Also, <b>-b</b> to report bytes and <b>-h</b> for human-readable.
<li>cleanse hash table info of the shell as to the location of executables</li>
<pre>hash -r</pre>
<li>alternative to <i>diff</i></li>
one can use <b>md5sum</b>
<li>list open TCP sockets</li>
<pre>lsof | grep TCP</pre>
<li>recursively copy remote folder and keep permissions and modes (alternative to <b>scp</b>)</li>
<pre>ssh mperdikeas@172.31.129.29 'tar cpf - cluster/' | tar xpvf -</pre>
<li>how to find broken links</li>
<pre>find -L -type l</pre>
I.e. find files following links (<b>-L</b>) and report those that remain links (<b>-type l</b>)
<li>find and kill an app</li>
Let's say we need to find and kill the Conkeror app:
<pre>
ps axwww | grep conkeror | grep -v grep
</pre>
<p>or, better yet:
<pre>
ps axwww | grep 'c[o]nkeror'
</pre>
(note: I don't see any difference with the 'axw' flags)<p>
Once you get the <i>pid</i> a <i>kill -7</i> should normaly suffice.
<li>troubleshooting sound problems in Ubuntu</li>
'Tis a long and sad tale. The gist of the matter (and what worked for me)
was a combination of purging <b>pulseaudio</b>
(including locally modified config files in /etc/pulse) and re-installing
it, (and doing the same for other Ubuntu audio libraries as well).
Helpfull material:
<ol>
<li><a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshootingProcedure">trouble shooting procedure</a>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iTlJ8BfqXUjaHO__TEdlkvuqB1WLOkGaudngc5SFLMI/edit?pli=1#heading=h.y9t02zg3awt4">
trouble shooting guide</a>
</ol>
Actually, the second was rather more helpful than the first.<p>
Litmus tests:
<pre>
play /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav
</pre>
... and the Skype echo service.<p>
Another thing to check out for is to make sure that the user
belongs to the audio group. I.e. do a:
<pre>
sudo \emacs -nw /etc/group
</pre>
Finally, I also tried <a href="http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-hardware-18/default-sound-card-in-ubuntu-564006/">this</href>
guide on setting the default audio card</a> although it didn't have any effect in this
particular case (maybe the problem wasn't there).
<li>re-enable the sound icon on Ubuntu precise</li>
The following incantation worked for me:
<pre>
sudo apt-get install indicator-sound
killall unity-panel-service
</pre>
<li>how to change a file's encoding from ISO8859-7 to UTF8</li>
It may happen that the <b>javac</b> compiler complains for the encoding
used in a file. Rather than using the -encoding option to <b>javac</b>
(in the build.xml, use &ltpresetdef&gt to setup defaults for all of your <b>javac</b> invocations and pass -Dfile.encoding=iso-8859-7)
one can also convert the file manually.
<p>To find the offending file:
<pre>
 $ ant  2>&1 | grep unmapp | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's,:.*,,' | sort | uniq
</pre>
convert it with iconv:
<pre>
iconv -f ISO8859-7 -t UTF-8 
</pre>
(you may also have to export LANG=en_US.UTF-8)
<li>piping with xargs</li>
To rm all java files (you need the -print0 and -0 options to work with filenames containing spaces etc.):
<pre>find . -iname \*.txt -print0 | xargs -0 rm</pre>
<li>pipe coloured output through less</li>
Use the 'ls -RG' option and make sure the original application (that
generates the colour-coded output) is set to --color=always if such option
exists.
<li>find the package a binary belongs to in Debian distros</li>
<p>E.g. find the package for <i>sensors</i>:
<pre>
dpkg -S $(which sensors)
</pre>
<li>monitor chipset and CPU sensors in Ubuntu</li>
Use <b>sensors</b> from package <i>lm-sensors</i> as in:
<pre>
watch sensors
</pre>
<li>change hostname in Ubuntu</li>
simply edit /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts (for 127.0.0.1). To flush the previous hostname
from various applications a reboot may be required.

<li>setting HTTP proxy in Ubuntu</li>
<pre>
export http_proxy="http://foo.bar:8080"
</pre>
subsequent wget requests will redirect to foo.bar:8080
<li>package managers</li>
apt is used in Debian, Ubuntu and rpm in Fedora, Redhat, Suse. apt is better.<p>
Typical <b>apt</b> commands: apt-get install, apt-cache search, apt-get autoremove, apt-get update.
<li>curl</li>
curl is a Linux utility that can be used to simulate HTTP GET and HTTP POST requests.
A simple:<pre>#curl www.in.gr</pre> ...will execute an HTTP GET against www.in.gr.
<li>SSE time</li>
get time in SSE:<pre>date +%s</pre>
<li>Linux print system information</li>
including kernel 32 or 64 bit:<pre>uname -a</pre>
x86_64 GNU/Linux indicates that you've a 64bit Linux kernel running.
If you use see i386/i486/i586/i686 it is a 32 bit kernel.
<li>Find if CPU is 32 or 64 bits</li>
<pre>grep ^flags /proc/cpuinfo | uniq | grep lm</pre></br> ("lm" means long mode CPU - 64 bit CPU)
<li>find installed packages</li>
<pre>
apt-cache search <search-string> - or -
dpkg --get-selections | grep <search-string>
</pre>
<li>how to find a file named "compile_decoder.sh" in a set of bz2 files</li>
<pre>for f in `ls *.bz2` ; do tar -jtvf  $f ; done | grep compile_decoder.sh</pre>
</br>
... Actually, the following also works and produces identical output:
<pre>for f in `ls *.bz2` ; do tar -jtvf $f | grep compile_decoder.sh ; done</pre>
<li>to find out the release</li>
<pre>$ lsb_release -a</pre>
<li>how to start xserver in Cygwin:<li>
<pre>startxwin</pre>
... and then to redirect X output from the new shell:
<pre>ssh -X mperdikeas@remote.location</pre>
<li>see all processes run by user 'mperdikeas':<li>
<pre>$ps -u mperdikeas</pre>
<li>bootable USB drive from ISO image</li>
                In order to create a bootable USB drive from an ISO image it
                is not possible to use dd and perform a binary data copy.
                Special magic has to be used. Ttsiodras sent me a folder
                with the necessary magic. Bottom line is that the files
                in the ISO image are actually copied and that special bits
                are set in the flash drive's filesystem to denote the
                partition as bootable. See folder CreateUSBstickFromISO.
                However I was not able to make it work; the USB flash
                drive was formated and created but I wasn't ablt to 
                boot it. In the end I just burned a CD. BTW the following
                page:
                http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/download
                created detailed instructions on how to create a USB
                flash drive and suggests another solution ("Pen Drive
                Linux's USB Installer").

                There is also another option which is to create a Live Linux
                USB stick or even a persistent one (with the ability to
                save files, install programs and so on). This option is
                possible using the "LinuxLive USB Creator 2.8.10.exe"
                program.
<li>to find the Linux kernel release and distro:</li>
    <pre>
        uname -mrs
        lsb_release -a
    </pre>
<li>how to find if a Linux machine is 32 or 64 bits:</li>
    <pre>uname -m</pre>
             - or -
    <pre>cat /proc/cpuinfo</pre>
<li>Print recursive size of folders (i.e. including contents):</li>
<pre>
                sudo du - s -m *
</pre>
                (because ls -lah only displays the size of the
                directory file).
<li>proper way to copy recursively directory tree a into b (including file permissions etc):</li>
                <pre>cp -a a b</pre>
</p>You don't need anything else and the internal symbolic links are nicely preserved.
<li>how to find in which package a binary belongs, e.g. the lsb_release binary:</li>
            <pre>dpkg -S $(which lsb_release)</pre>
<li>to show the versions of debian apt packages use the apt_show_versions utility</li>
<li>apt things ...</li>
            The /etc/apt/sources.list file is not directly related to the 
            operations of the:
                <b>apt-get dist-upgrade</b> command
            the dist-upgrade command always stays in the same Debian version
            but implements the progression: stable->testing->unstable.
            So, for instance from the stable phase it takes two invocations
            of the dist-upgrade to reach the unstable phase; from the
            testing phase only one. And you can't go backwards.
            The /etc/apt/sources.list file "simply" provides the URL of
            the repositories for each version.
