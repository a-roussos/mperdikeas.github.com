GET:
<pre>curl -HAccept:text/plain http://example.com/base</pre>

PUT:

DELETE:
<pre>curl -XDELETE http://example.com/base/user/123</pre>

POST:
<pre>curl -d "param1=value1&param2=value2" http://example.com/base/</pre>
<p>
Another curl tip: To send a POST request whose data is
not in application/x-www-urlencoded format, use
the --data-binary option instead of --data.

tr -cs A-Za-z '\n' |
	tr A-Z a-z |
	sort |
	uniq -c |
	sort -rn |
	sed ${1}q
</pre>
What it does:
<ul>
<li>Make one-word lines by transliterating the complement (-c) of the alphabet into newlines (note the quoted newline), and squeezing out (-s) multiple newlines.
<li>Transliterate upper case to lower case.
<li>Sort to bring identical words together.
<li>Replace each run of duplicate words with a single representative and include a count (-c).
<li>Sort in reverse (-r) numeric (-n) order.
<li>Pass through the stream editor; quit (q) after printing the number of lines designated by the script's first argument.
</ul>

<li><b><u>The scp utility to download / upload files from remote server (no FTP)</b></u><p>
To download recursively a whole folder from remote directory:
<pre>scp -r mperdikeas@elrond:~/TAPKIT/Conversions/Genesis/sources-auto /cygdrive/c/fromElrond</pre>
To upload single file to remote directory:
<pre>scp buildSpecification.py mperdikeas@elrond:~/TAPKIT/Conversions/Genesis/python</pre>

scp can be setup to not prompt for password using ssh-keygen and appending the public key to the remote host(s)'s
 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file (for the respective user).

<li><b><u>How to browse the web from a different IP address:</b></u><p>
One can use the SOCKS protocol. The idea would be to open an SSH tunnel to a remote machine and then configure the browser to use the local machine as SOCKS host. The browser would then encapsulate all HTTP traffic into a SOCKS packet and send it through the tunnel to the remote SSH server which will also decapsulate the SOCKS protocol. So, the resolution of the domain name at the HTTP GET will be done at the remote server. Instructions for Firefox:
<ol>
<li>open cygwin shell in local machine and at the prompt enter:
    ssh -D 9987 root@tapeditor.com
<li>it will typically output something about an RSA fingerprint at which point you type yes
<li>you are prompted for password (enter it)
<li>you are now in the remote host and the tunnel is operational.
<li>fire Mozilla Firefox
<li>find the Firefox's proxy config page (tools->options->Network->Settings) and setup a Manual proxy configuration with SOCKS Host the local machine (enter "localhost", port 9987 (the one used in step [1] - it can be any port) and SOCKS version v5.
<li>if you now visit www.whatismyipaddress.com you see the (usually public static IP address) of the other end of the tunnel.
<li>you can now browse the web using that public IP address (so long as the tunnel opened in step [4] remains open).

Standard emacs shortcuts such as C-l, C-p and C-r come very handy in bash. C-l clears the screen whereas C-r allows
easy repetition of previous commands (much better than history or C-p)
