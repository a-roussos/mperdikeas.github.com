<li>add a line at the beginning of every text file in a group</li>
Use <b>sed</b> with <b>for</b> iteration on <b>find</b> results.<br>
E.g. the following adds package headers in a group of Java files:
<pre>
for f in $(find src/ -type f -iname \*.java) ; do sed -i '1ipackage _int.esa.esavo.harvesting;' $f ; done
</pre>
<li>recursively find the latest modified file in a directory</li>

<li>ask <b>diff</b> to ignore lines starting with Java single-line comments</li>
<pre>diff --ignore-matching-lines='^//' Foo.java</pre>
<li>How to obtain the sha256 of a password</li>
Say the password is "foo":
<pre>
echo -n foo | sha256sum
</pre>
The <b>-n</b> is necessary as otherwise echo will also sent the new line character to be SHA256-encoded as part of the password. In cases of salting the usually arrangement is a simple concatenation of the salt followed by the password (in that order so the cracker doesn't have an attack vector). So
if password is "foo" and salt is "salt":
<pre>
echo -n saltfoo | sha256sum

<li>Programmer's grep</li>
Use the <b>ack</b> utility. It is by default only operating on a 
white list of files. With the <b>-u</b> option it operates on all
files except those on the black list (.svn etc).
<li>find files and get the 10 most recently modified</li>
<pre>
find . -iname *.script -type f -printf '%T@ %p\n' | sort -k 1nr | sed 's/^[^ ]* //' | head -n 10

This method ensures that nothing's stored anywhere.
<li>to easily navigate folder hierarchies in Bash:</li>
<pre>sudo apt-get install autojump</pre>
<li>to record some task in Bash</li>
Use <b>script</b> followed by CTRL+D to stop recording (the output is 
written in file 'typescript')
<li>how to ensure that no # appears in ini files except as the first character</li>
<i> this cost me several hours with a shiro.ini cookie path I had set
where the comment (or so I thought) was interpreted as part of the path</i>
<pre>
find . -iname \*.ini -exec grep '^[^#].*#' /dev/null '{}' ';' 
</pre>
<li>chain logical expressions in bash</li>
<pre>find . -iname \*.csv -exec sh -c "grep foo {} && echo {}" \;</pre>
<li>find files and print their absolute path name</li>
<pre>find  $(pwd) -iname report2.jrxml</pre>
<li>Thing to notice when trying to find the types of files</li>
The below code might not working depending on the environment settings,
e.g. if the grep command outputs special characters (like bold):
<pre>
find  . -iname \*.java | grep facade | while read f ; do file $f ; done
</pre>
In such, cases do a:
<pre>
find  . -iname \*.java | /bin/grep facade | while read f ; do file $f ; done
</pre>
<li>'materialize' soft-links - easy way</li>
<pre>cp -pr -L --copy-contents</pre>
<li>'materialize' soft-links - trying to be clever way</li>
We do it in two steps:
    <ol>
    <li>create the directories</li>
    <pre>cd srcPath && find . -type d -exec mkdir -p /destPath/'{}' ';'</pre>
    <li>copy the contents - use the <b><i>cat</i></b>trickery to always get the data</li>
    <pre>cd srcPath && find . ! -type d -exec sh -c 'cat "{}" > /destPath/"{}"' \;</pre>
    </ol>
<li>trace the system calls by an executable</li>
<pre>strace -f ./NeuroCode.exe Project.xml  2>&1 | less</pre>
Once in the output of <b>less</b>, you can use a <b>/</b> to search for <b>NeuroCode.exe</b>
and find the system calls it makes.
<li>more elegant 'ps aux | grep terminal | grep -v grep'</li>
The following incantation:
<pre>ps aux | grep '[t]erminal'</pre>
will return all lines containing <i>terminal</i> which the line you invoked does not.
<li>Generate import statements out of the classes of a jar</li>
<pre>
jar tvf Orders-ejb.jar  | grep entities| cut -c38- | grep -v /$ | sed 's,^,import ,' | sed 's,/,.,g'
</pre>
(in the above example at the sed command the comma character is used as the separator - this is handier
than the usual slash character when one has to replaces slashes)
<li>Total number of lines in all found files</li>
<pre>find . -iname \*.java -print0 | wc -l --files0-from -</pre>
<li>Find all different file types in a folder hierarchy</li>
<pre>
find . -exec file {} \; | awk -F/ '{print $NF}' | awk -F: '{print $NF}' | sort | uniq
</pre>
<li>Find all XML files with a specific string inside ("login-module") and print the name of the file concerned</li>
<pre>
find . -iname \*.xml -exec grep "login-module" '{}' /dev/null \;
</pre>
The following simpler version also seems to work:
<pre>
find . -iname *.xml -exec grep "login-module" {} /dev/null \;
</pre>
<li>Return just the names of the jar files in a <u>find</u></li>
The <u>cut</u> utility cannot be used to return only the last field, but
<u>awk</u> can do the trick:
<pre>
find jboss-as-7.1.1.Final/ -iname *.jar | awk -F/ '{print $NF}'
</pre>
<li>Search for a class in a set of jar files</li>
To search all jars in the current folder and below for class named a.b.c.D do a:
<pre>
find . -iname *.jar | while read JARF; do jar tvf $JARF | grep a/b/c/D.class && echo $JARF ; done
</pre>
if there is too much output, try:
<pre>
find /home/mperdikeas/git-jboss/ -iname *.jar | while read f ; do echo $f && (jar tvf $f | grep a.b.c.D) ; done | grep -B1 ^\
</pre> ("." instead of "/" works practically as well as it stands for any character).

<li>How to count the number of lines with exactly five spaces</li>

<li>How to use curl to test GET, POST, etc.</li>

GET:
<pre>curl -HAccept:text/plain http://example.com/base</pre>

PUT:
<pre>curl -XPUT -HContent-type:text/plain --data "stuff:morestuff" http://example.com/base?param=val</pre>

DELETE:
<pre>curl -XDELETE http://example.com/base/user/123</pre>

POST:
<pre>curl -d "param1=value1&param2=value2" http://example.com/base/</pre>
<p>
Another curl tip: To send a POST request whose data is
not in application/x-www-urlencoded format, use
the --data-binary option instead of --data.

What it does:
<ul>
<li>Make one-word lines by transliterating the complement (-c) of the alphabet into newlines (note the quoted newline), and squeezing out (-s) multiple newlines.
<li>Transliterate upper case to lower case.
<li>Sort to bring identical words together.
<li>Replace each run of duplicate words with a single representative and include a count (-c).
<li>Sort in reverse (-r) numeric (-n) order.
<li>Pass through the stream editor; quit (q) after printing the number of lines designated by the script's first argument.

<li>How not to lose tty context</li>
A utility that allows you to save all tty context and re-connect and recover everything in case of a connection lost (e.g. ssh) is screen. Invoked with "screen". Reconnect with "screen -r". To detach from the screen type "ctrl-a d". The screen deamon is visible with "ps auex".


<li>The scp utility to download / upload files from remote server (no FTP)</li>
To download recursively a whole folder from remote directory:
<pre>scp -r mperdikeas@elrond:~/TAPKIT/Conversions/Genesis/sources-auto /cygdrive/c/fromElrond</pre>
To upload single file to remote directory:
<pre>scp buildSpecification.py mperdikeas@elrond:~/TAPKIT/Conversions/Genesis/python</pre>

scp can be setup to not prompt for password using ssh-keygen and appending the public key to the remote host(s)'s
 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file (for the respective user).

<li>How to browse the web from a different IP address:</li>
One can use the SOCKS protocol. The idea would be to open an SSH tunnel to a remote machine and then configure the browser to use the local machine as SOCKS host. The browser would then encapsulate all HTTP traffic into a SOCKS packet and send it through the tunnel to the remote SSH server which will also decapsulate the SOCKS protocol. So, the resolution of the domain name at the HTTP GET will be done at the remote server. Instructions for Firefox:
<ol>
<li>open cygwin shell in local machine and at the prompt enter:
    ssh -D 9987 root@tapeditor.com
<li>it will typically output something about an RSA fingerprint at which point you type yes
<li>you are prompted for password (enter it)
<li>you are now in the remote host and the tunnel is operational.
<li>fire Mozilla Firefox
<li>find the Firefox's proxy config page (tools->options->Network->Settings) and setup a Manual proxy configuration with SOCKS Host the local machine (enter "localhost", port 9987 (the one used in step [1] - it can be any port) and SOCKS version v5.
<li>if you now visit www.whatismyipaddress.com you see the (usually public static IP address) of the other end of the tunnel.
<li>you can now browse the web using that public IP address (so long as the tunnel opened in step [4] remains open).

<li>emacs shortcuts in bash</li>
Standard emacs shortcuts such as C-l, C-p and C-r come very handy in bash. C-l clears the screen whereas C-r allows
easy repetition of previous commands (much better than history or C-p)
