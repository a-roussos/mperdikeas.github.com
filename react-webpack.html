    <li>how to solve CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues with webpack</li>
<p>
    It is often the case when doing development in Webpack that you
    have your, e.g. React JXS code running in the webpack development server
    (the one you typically launch with <code>npm run dev</code>) and you need
    that front-end code to access via Ajax some back-end services, e.g. some
    JAX-RS module deployed in a Tomcat container.
</p>
<p>
  In those cases, one runs into <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS'>CORS</a> issues.
  To solve the problem you have to enable CORS on the <b>backend</b> module as described
  in <a href='jax-rs.html#jersey-1.9-cors'>this note</a>.
  </p>
  I have created an <a href="https://github.com/mperdikeas/archetypes/tree/master/jax-rs/004-jaxrs-example-with-CORS-and-a-frontend-webpack-app-in-dev-server">archetype project</a> to exemplify the full chain, from a React front-end application running
  in webpack development server to a back-end JAX-RS module deployed in a Tomcat container.
