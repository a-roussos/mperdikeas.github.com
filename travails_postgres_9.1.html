        Basically, you just have to follow the instructions on the first article and you're done.
        The second article is just for additional reference (I didn't have to use any of the commands found there).
        The only difference are that I used the "-d" switch at the "createuser" command (instead of the
        "-D" switch), as I wanted my new user to be able to create databases. Also the instructions
        mention that the user you create with:
        <pre>
            sudo -u postgre createuser -D -P someuser
        </pre>
        can't connect to the database, which is misleading if the user happens to be a local Linux user
        (apparently these users can authenticate with the "peer" mechanism). But if you chose any other
        name then you indeed have to edit /etc/postgresql/9.1/main/pg_hba.conf file to change the
        "local all all peer" line to "local all all md5". <p>

        To create the database, after I created a user "hr", I did a:
<pre>psql -U hr createdb myhr</pre>

Afterwards, one can create a new database (say "masterdet") by connecting
as user "hr" without having to use the option suggested in the article (masquareding as user "postgres" by running the "createdb" command under a "sudo -u postgres". What I basically did to create a new database was:
<pre>createdb -U hr -O hr masterdet</pre>

        Finally, instead of the:
        <pre>sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.1</pre>
        line, a simpler:
        <pre>sudo apt-get install postgresql</pre>
        will do (gets the latest).
