<li>best pythonic library for HTTP</li>
The cleanest and most comprehensive library at the time of this writing
appears to be <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/">Python Requests</a>.
<li>graphical component library for JavaScript</li>
wijmo from component one (which also provides bindings for knockout.js).
<li>JavaScript future-oriented keywords</li>
knockout.js, typescript (Microsoft), view-model/model-view, observable model.
<li>automated web testing</li>
<b>Sikuli</b> is another way to automate screen navigation based on 
              image recognition.
<b>Selenium</b> is implemented as a Firefox plugin and only works there,
<b>mechanize</b> is a fairly low-level python library that doesn't however
emulate the browser and doesn't give you access to the socket, an alternative would be the <b>python-requests</b> library
<li>python XML parsing</li>
Use python-lxml
<li>software stack and approaches for open-source SOA</li>
<b>jQuery UI</b> with <b>Backbone.js</b> for <b>MVC</b> pattern
and REST-based web services for the business logic using
JAX-RS (Java API for RESTful Web Services).
Also, using JPA by directly authoring the object model and
deriving the DB schema. <b>Vaadin</b> results in a stack whose thickness
is comparable or maybe thicker than <b>GWT</b>. It is not
advisable for more than a few dozen users. Apache Lucene results
can be cached. Fluid and responsive web design.

        install it with: <pre>sudo apt-get install python-twill</pre>.
        <b>mechanize</b> and <b>Beautiful Soup</b> (both python libraries)
        are also to be used with <b>twill</b>
        Actually, it is better if tests are written directly on top of Mechanize
        as twill is not UTF-compatible and moreover forces you to deal with the 
        HTML Ids of various elements which can be problematic in JSF-generated code
        where the testing code may break when a new button is added.
