it's guaranteed to run after all /etc.rc.n levels.<p>
Important: (a) call any service scripts in the background
(b) there is no need to worry about nohup. For completeness, here's the /etc/rc.local script I 've been using in COAST:
<p>
[/etc/rc.local script starts on the next line:]<p>
<pre>
#!/bin/sh -e
#
# rc.local
#
# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.
# Make sure that the script will "exit 0" on success or any other
# value on error.
#
# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution
# bits.
#
# By default this script does nothing.

exit 0
