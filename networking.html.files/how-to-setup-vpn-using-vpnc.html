    <h1>How to setup a VPN using <tt>vpnc</tt> on Linux</h1>
    <a href='https://www.lullabot.com/articles/using-vpnc-as-a-command-line-vpn-client'>source</a>
    <p>
    You first need to install <tt>vpnc</tt>:
    <pre>
sudo apt-get install vpnc</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      Following that you can directly invoke <tt>vpnc</tt> (it requires <tt>sudo</tt>):
      <pre>
sudo vpnc</pre>      
      &hellip; and answer the prompts as shown below (mutatis mutandis):
      <pre>
$ sudo vpnc
Enter IPSec gateway address: &lt;enter the server address&gt;
Enter IPSec ID for 131.142.33.100: &lt;this is the group name (ask you network admins)&gt;
Enter IPSec secret for perdikeasm@131.142.33.100: &lt;the password for the group (again ask the network admins)&gt;
Enter username for 131.142.33.100: &lt; your username &gt;
Enter password for perdikeasm@131.142.33.100: &lt; your password&gt;</pre>
    </p>
    <p>In my case the network admins provided the values they had to provide in a CfA email on 2016-12-16.</p>
    <p>
      You can then disconnect with:
      <pre>
sudo vpnc-disconnect</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      To avoid having to manually enter all this information I did the following:
      <pre>
sudo -i
cp /etc/vpnc/default.conf /etc/vpnc/myvpn.conf
\emacs -nw /etc/vpnc/myvpn.conf</pre>
      And basically set the above values in the <tt>myvpn.conf</tt> file (remember to uncomment the lines).<br/>
      NB: I had to keep the line that read: <tt>IKE Authmode hybrid</tt> commented as I was getting
      <a href='http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/vpnc/devel/3719'>this problem</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you have the <tt>myvpn.conf</tt> file properly setup you can then simply do:
      <pre>sudo vpnc myvpn.conf</pre> (without having to be in the <tt>/etc/vpnc/</tt> directory)
    </p>
    <p>To bring down the VPN do <code>sudo vpnc-disconnect</code> like before.</p>
    <p>For added security (if you are that type of person) you may leave the password line commented
    as well, this way you'll be prompted for the password each time.</p>
