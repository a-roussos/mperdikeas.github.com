    <h1>Do a double (two spans) SSH tunnel between two machines (with a third machine sitting in the middle)</h1>
    <p>It is sometimes necessary to connect to a final destination node via an intermedite node that serves
      as an SSH stepping stone (and is typically in the DMZ).
      To establish some terminology lets use the following:
      <dl>
        <dt>A</dt><dd>your local node</dd>
        <dt>B</dt><dd>the intermediate node</dd>
        <dt>C</dt><dd>the destination node</dd>
      </dl>
          
    </p>
    <p>Once you have this chain of SSH accesses &mdash; even with an intermediary stepping stone &mdash; you
      can effectively access every port of the node C.</p>
    <p>
      There's two ways to go about it:
      <ul>
        <li>a single SSH invocation to bore both spans (using an embedded subsequent SSH command to execute)</li>
        <li>two separate SSH invocations, each boring a single span</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>In both cases it is a good idea to <a href='ssh-public-key-authorization.html'>authorize public keys</a> on node B (for node A) and on node C (for node B).</p>
    <h2>single SSH invocation that bores both tunnels</h2>
    I wanted to directly access port 8300 where PostgreSQL was running on machine C and used
    the following:
    <pre>
ssh mperdikeas@ssh.esac.esa.int -L 18300:localhost:18302 ssh -N voops@esavo00.esac.esa.int -L 18302:localhost:8300
    </pre>
    &hellip; following the above I was able to point <a href='https://www.dbvis.com'>DbVisualizer</a> in the local machine A (host: <tt>localhost</tt>, port: <tt>18300</tt>)
    and access the PostgreSQL database that was running in machine C.
<p>
  <b>NB:</b> the above incantation uses the port 18302 on the middle (stepping stone) machine. Should this port by in use
  the boring will fail. In that case just try 18303, 18304, etc. until you find an open port. You will obviously have to replace
  the stepping stone machine's port in both places where it occurs. It is for this reason (the uncertainty over which ports
  will be discovered to be open in the middle machine) that I have not crystallized the above incantation as a script.
</p>
<p>
  <b>NB2:</b> the above note applies to the next method, too.
</p>
    <h2>two separate SSH invocations that bore one tunnel each</h2>
    <p>
    For a case similar to the above, use the following on machine A (mutatis mutandis):
    <pre>
ssh mperdikeas@ssh.esac.esa.int -L 18300:localhost:18302
    </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
    &hellip; and the following on machine A (mutatis mutandis):
    <pre>
ssh voops@esavo00.esac.esa.int -L 18302:localhost:8300
    </pre>
    &hellip; the end result was the same in both cases.
