    <h1>on the need to convey X-Forwarded-* headers</h1>
    <p>
      When using reverse proxies (SSL terminators, load balancers etc.), whether
      just one or multiple, in tandem, your application will typically
      reside in an upstream server (more accurately called an origin server in this
      context). A case that can come up is that your application might need to redirect
      the user to a second application (perhaps deployed in another server) in which
      case you 'd expect that second application, after it's done, to redirect the
      user's browser back to the first application, to the page he was viewing so as
      to continue his browsing. A typical use case for that would be a filter that
      redirects the user's browser to authenticate to some common authentication
      service (in the <a href='cas.html'>CAS</a> model).
    </p>
    <p>
      In those cases success of the eventual redirection is premised on the ability
      of your application (deployed in the origin server) to reliably restructure/obtain
      the URL requested by the user's browser. This is impossible to achieve (with
      heuristics at least) unless the following <tt>X-Forwarded</tt> headers are provided:
      <ul>
        <li><tt>X-Forwarded-Host</tt></li>
        <li><tt>X-Forwarded-Proto</tt></li>
        <li><tt>X-Forwarded-Port</tt></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      In a setting where Apache is used as the proxy and Tomcat as the origin,
      I understand that the following headers are provided iff the <tt>httpd.conf</tt> file has: <pre>ProxyPreserveHost On</pre>
      <ul>
        <li><tt>X-Forwarded-Host</tt></li>
        <li><tt>X-Forwarded-Server</tt></li>
        <li><tt>X-Forwarded-For</tt></li>        
      </ul>
      &hellip; the above is useful but not enough:
      <ul>
        <li>the <tt>X-Forwarded-For</tt> is the IP address of the browser and is totally irrelevant for this discussion</li>
        <li>the <tt>X-Forwarded-Host</tt> was not needed in my case as the <tt>X-Forwarded-Server</tt> contained a more pertinent value (see <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/q/43689625/274677'>this SO question of mine</a> on this topic)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      I understand that to pass the essential (but missing from the above list)
      <tt>X-Forwarded-Proto</tt> and <tt>X-Forwarded-Port</tt> headers, they have to be <b>hardcoded</b>
      in the Apache <tt>httpd.conf</tt> as follows (assuming that our Apache is only accepting SSL
      connections on 443):
      <pre>
RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto "https"
RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Port "443"</pre>
    </p>
    <p>I also understand that the fact that the values of those two headers have to be
      provided in a hardcoded way in the Apache configuration (as opposed to being deduced
      from the incoming HTTP request) is a limitation of the <tt>mod_proxy</tt>.
