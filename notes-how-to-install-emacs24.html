I followed the instructions found here:<p>

<a href="https://launchpad.net/~cassou/+archive/emacs">
         https://launchpad.net/~cassou/+archive/emacs
</a>
<p>
(I got there from:<p>
   <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/149562/how-to-upgrade-to-emacs-24-1">
            http://askubuntu.com/questions/149562/how-to-upgrade-to-emacs-24-1
   </a>
)
<p>
Be sure to also read the instructions in the link of the "Signing key".
After the "sudo apt-get update" I then did a "sudo apt-get install emacs24"
and had Emacs 24 installed.

================================================================
<p>
Before succeeding I tried following these instructions instead:
<p>
<a href="http://batsov.com/articles/2011/10/09/getting-started-with-emacs-24/">
         http://batsov.com/articles/2011/10/09/getting-started-with-emacs-24/
</a>
<p>
(which points you to:
 <a href="http://emacs.naquadah.org/">
    http://emacs.naquadah.org/
 </a>
)
<p>
but it didn't work. The reason was that I was being silly because the link at http:emacs.naquadah.org ALSO points to Damien Cassou's page (it says: "If you are looking for the Ubuntu packages, Damien Cassou now maintains an emacs-snapshot PPA.") but I was tired and my eyes were sore and didn't notice it.
