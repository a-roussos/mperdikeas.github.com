<b>tl;dr</b>:Avoid arginine, load up on lysine but don't get too acid. And use a Q-tip coated in vaseline to apply Zovirax
so that your fingers never come in contact with the virus (to prevent secondary infections in other parts of your body).
Vaseline ensures that the cotton tip of the Q-tip doesn't absorb the Zovirax cream.<br>On the dry-versus-moist question,
keep it moist with a thick coat of vaseline (lack of oxygen kills the virus and if you apply vaseline on the scab it falls off faster).
After the scab falls off apply Carmex cream for an extra week to speed up healing. I've also heard good things about
the herb "Melissa Officinalis" (melissoxorto) but haven't tried it.
