<li>how to make a replacement on every line with <b>awk</b></li>

<li>properly quoting arguments to underlying invocations</li>
Inside a bash script, always use <code>"$1"</code> to pass an argument to an underlying program
instead of just <code>$1</code>. See: ~/playground/java/why-I-should-always-quote-arguments for more.
<li>how to use <b>diff</b> to generate a patch in a <b>Makefile</b></li>
<i>this is really a bash topic (see below)</i>.
Relative SO discussion <a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/q/100786/24044">here</a>.<br>
The Makefile run will fail when a command that's executed as part of a recipe returns a non-zero exit code,
unless the command is preceded with "-" (in which case it ignores the exit code).<br>
This is exactly what's happenning in the <code>~/playground/patch/Makefile</code>
Makefile, also shown below:
<pre>
patch:
	-diff -u b a > b2a.patch
	patch -o b.corrected b < b2a.patch
	diff a b.corrected

clean:
	rm -f b2a.patch b.corrected
</pre>

However, this idiom will ask mask real problems (such as using <b>-dif</b> instead of <b>-diff</b>.
Therefore the correct way to solve this conundrum (i.e. to not don't ignore the exit value, but also to not fail if it's non-zero)
is shown in <code>/home/mperdikeas/playground/ant-patch/02/Makefile</code> file, also shown below:

<pre>
patch: FORCE
	diff -u src/a/random/path/b b.corrected > b2a.patch; [ $$? -eq 1 ]
	ant
	diff src/a/random/path/a src/a/random/path/b.corrected

clean:
	rm -f b2a.patch src/a/random/path/b.corrected

FORCE:
</pre>

The ability to use the following syntax: <code>; [ $? -eq 1 ]</code> is plain bash (the double '$' in the
Makefile is to account for Make's escaping conventions), as is shown in the following bash examples:

<pre>
$ echo $[3+2]
5
$ [ $[3+2] -eq 5 ]
$ echo $?
0
$ [ $[3+2] -eq 6 ]
$ echo $?
1

<li>using named pipes in Bash</li>
<a href="http://www.hollenback.net/NamedPipesInBash">original article</a>
<pre>diff <(ls) <(ls)</pre>
Named pipes can be created with <b>mkfifo</b>:
<pre>
mkfifo foo
find ~ > foo &
tail -f foo
</pre>
The difference of the above to creating a file is that the size of a named pipe is 0.
A named pipe lives on the filesystem and survives a reboot but never holds any data, only metadata.
<li>how to see the alias of a command in the shell</li>
<pre>
$ type emacs
emacs is aliased to `emacs -nw'
</pre>
(or the more low tech: <tt>alias | grep emacs</tt>)
<li>how to recursively diff two directories and exclude certain files (e.g. .svn files in case of a subversion repository)</li>
<pre>diff -r --exclude=.svn dir-a dir-b</pre>
<li>count the number of "new" keywords in a set of files (per file - not total):</li>
<pre>grep -c new `find . -name '*.java'`</pre>
<li>count total number of lines in all Java files</li>
<pre>wc -l `find . -name '*.java'`</pre>
<br/>the following also works (and strangely gives a different result, and requires a CTRL+C at the end):
<pre>find . -name '*.java' | xargs wc -l</pre>
<li>record shell commands and their input/output</li>
<br/>to record:
<pre>$script session.log</pre>
<br/>to exit a recording session: <tt>exit</tt>
<li><tt>seq</tt> program</li>
<pre>for i in `seq 1 10`; do echo "number is: " $i ; done</pre>
<li>redirect standard error to standard out and both to file</li>
<pre>gksudo software-center > trace 2>&1</pre>
<b>2>&1</b> means "put the output of channel 2 (<i>stderr</i>) to where channel 1 (<i>stdout</i>) currently goes"
which is why the redirection to file has to occur before the <i>stderr</i> redirection to <i>stdout</i>.
<li>add a line at the beginning of every text file in a group</li>
Use <b>sed</b> with <b>for</b> iteration on <b>find</b> results.<br>
E.g. the following adds package headers in a group of Java files:
<pre>
for f in $(find src/ -type f -iname \*.java) ; do sed -i '1ipackage _int.esa.esavo.harvesting;' $f ; done

<li>ask <b>diff</b> to ignore lines starting with Java single-line comments</li>
<pre>diff --ignore-matching-lines='^//' Foo.java</pre>
<li>How to obtain the sha256 of a password</li>
Say the password is "foo":
<pre>
echo -n foo | sha256sum
</pre>
The <b>-n</b> is necessary as otherwise echo will also sent the new line character to be SHA256-encoded as part of the password. In cases of salting the usually arrangement is a simple concatenation of the salt followed by the password (in that order so the cracker doesn't have an attack vector). So
if password is "foo" and salt is "salt":
<pre>
echo -n saltfoo | sha256sum

<li>Thing to notice when trying to find the types of files</li>
The below code might not working depending on the environment settings,
e.g. if the grep command outputs special characters (like bold):
<pre>
find  . -iname \*.java | grep facade | while read f ; do file $f ; done
</pre>
In such, cases do a:
<pre>
find  . -iname \*.java | /bin/grep facade | while read f ; do file $f ; done

<li>'materialize' soft-links - easy way</li>
<pre>cp -pr -L --copy-contents</pre>
<li>'materialize' soft-links - trying to be clever way</li>
We do it in two steps:
    <ol>
    <li>create the directories</li>
    <pre>cd srcPath && find . -type d -exec mkdir -p /destPath/'{}' ';'</pre>
    <li>copy the contents - use the <b><i>cat</i></b>trickery to always get the data</li>
    <pre>cd srcPath && find . ! -type d -exec sh -c 'cat "{}" > /destPath/"{}"' \;</pre>
    </ol>
<li>trace the system calls by an executable</li>
<pre>strace -f ./NeuroCode.exe Project.xml  2>&1 | less</pre>
Once in the output of <b>less</b>, you can use a <b>/</b> to search for <b>NeuroCode.exe</b>
and find the system calls it makes.
<li>more elegant 'ps aux | grep terminal | grep -v grep'</li>
The following incantation:
<pre>ps aux | grep '[t]erminal'</pre>
will return all lines containing <i>terminal</i> which the line you invoked does not.
<li>Generate import statements out of the classes of a jar</li>
<pre>
jar tvf Orders-ejb.jar  | grep entities| cut -c38- | grep -v /$ | sed 's,^,import ,' | sed 's,/,.,g'
</pre>
(in the above example at the sed command the comma character is used as the separator - this is handier
than the usual slash character when one has to replaces slashes)
<li>Total number of lines in all found files</li>
<pre>find . -iname \*.java -print0 | wc -l --files0-from -</pre>
<li>Find all different file types in a folder hierarchy</li>
<pre>

</pre>
<li>Find all XML files with a specific string inside ("login-module") and print the name of the file concerned</li>
<pre>

The following simpler version also seems to work:
<pre>
find . -iname *.xml -exec grep "login-module" {} /dev/null \;
</pre>
<li>Return just the names of the jar files in a <u>find</u></li>
The <u>cut</u> utility cannot be used to return only the last field, but
<u>awk</u> can do the trick:
<pre>
find jboss-as-7.1.1.Final/ -iname *.jar | awk -F/ '{print $NF}'
</pre>
<li>Search for a class in a set of jar files</li>
To search all jars in the current folder and below for class named a.b.c.D do a:
<pre>
find . -iname *.jar | while read JARF; do jar tvf $JARF | grep a/b/c/D.class && echo $JARF ; done
</pre>
if there is too much output, try:
<pre>
find /home/mperdikeas/git-jboss/ -iname *.jar | while read f ; do echo $f && (jar tvf $f | grep a.b.c.D) ; done | grep -B1 ^\
</pre> ("." instead of "/" works practically as well as it stands for any character).

<li>How to browse the web from a different IP address:</li>
One can use the SOCKS protocol. The idea would be to open an SSH tunnel to a remote machine and then configure the browser to use the local machine as SOCKS host. The browser would then encapsulate all HTTP traffic into a SOCKS packet and send it through the tunnel to the remote SSH server which will also decapsulate the SOCKS protocol. So, the resolution of the domain name at the HTTP GET will be done at the remote server. Instructions for Firefox:
<ol>
<li>open cygwin shell in local machine and at the prompt enter:
    ssh -D 9987 root@tapeditor.com
<li>it will typically output something about an RSA fingerprint at which point you type yes
<li>you are prompted for password (enter it)
<li>you are now in the remote host and the tunnel is operational.
<li>fire Mozilla Firefox
<li>find the Firefox's proxy config page (tools->options->Network->Settings) and setup a Manual proxy configuration with SOCKS Host the local machine (enter "localhost", port 9987 (the one used in step [1] - it can be any port) and SOCKS version v5.
<li>if you now visit www.whatismyipaddress.com you see the (usually public static IP address) of the other end of the tunnel.
<li>you can now browse the web using that public IP address (so long as the tunnel opened in step [4] remains open).
