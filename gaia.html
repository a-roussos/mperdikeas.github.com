<h3>travails</h3>
<ol>
    <li>nginx</li>
    install the stable version of nginx by running:
    <pre>
        sudo apt-add-repository ppa:nginx/stable
        sudo apt-get install nginx-full
    </pre>
    A configuration (/etc/nginx/nginx.conf) file I used to
    implement simple Round-Robin is <a href="nginx.conf">this one</a>.
</ol>
<h3>things to keep in mind</h3>
<ol>
    <li>does the container support minimal updating?(see 
    <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jtp07294/index.html">here</a> for more)
    </li>
    <li>invalidate the session as soon as you know the user's finished
        (don't wait for it to expire)
    </li>
    <li>remove session items as soon as you don't need them</li>

</ol>

    <li>Great (for the very first steps) guide on clustering in JBoss AS7.1.1</li>
        I followed the instructions given
        <a href="http://middlewaremagic.com/jboss/?p=1952">here</a> 
        for the 1st configuration (JBoss AS 7.1.1 instances on the same
        box) and it worked like a charm. Note that you don't need to 
        configure the multicast group address on the network - just 
        give them any multicast group address and the'll find each other.
        Look for 'Number of cluster members:' on the output - the 
        second one that comes up should print: '2'.
