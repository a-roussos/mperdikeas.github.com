    <h1>how to configure a datasource in JBoss EAP 6.2 (possibly valid for EAP 7 as well)</h1>
    <p>Writeup of what I did December 2016 in order to configure a datasource in JBoss EAP 6.2.
    </p>
    <p>The configuration of a datasource may require two distinct steps:
      <ol type='a'>
        <li>installation of a module for the JDBC driver (if not already installed)</li>
        Steps #1 up to #5 in the list below.
        <li>definition of the datasource</li>
        Step #6 in the list below.
      </ol>
      At the time of this writing I have failed to discover a method that would allow me to ship the
      JDBC driver inside my WAR (as I can do, e.g., in Tomcat). Apparently the JDBC driver
      in JBoss has to be installed as a
      "module" in the server which is unfortunate as it decreases my options in terms of scripting
      and cannot be captured in source control.
    </p>
    <p>I followed a kind of amalgam between the instructions found
      <a href='https://zorq.net/b/2011/07/12/adding-a-mysql-datasource-to-jboss-as-7/'>here</a>
      and <a href='http://resolvethis.com/jboss-database-driver/'>here</a>. Apparently these instructions
      are equally applicable to JBoss EAP 6 and/or 7. Furthermore, in my particular case, the database
      I was trying to connect to was a Sybase ASE 15 (or 16, am not sure at the moment) so the exotic
      factor is high.
    </p>
    <p>
      <ol class='pink-circles'>
        <li>obtain the JDBC driver's JAR</li>
        I obtained the jar with an open-source Sybase JDBC driver via Ivy with the following dependency:
        <xmp><dependency org="net.sourceforge.jtds" name="jtds" rev="1.3.1"/></xmp>
        <p>In accordance with what is expected from a JDBC jar, it contains a file <tt>java.sql.Driver</tt>
          in the <tt>META-INF/services</tt> directory:

<pre>$ jar tvf jtds-1.3.1.jar  | grep Driver
  33 Sat Jun 08 18:22:50 EDT 2013 META-INF/services/java.sql.Driver
</pre> &hellip; which spells out the class name of the driver, in our case: <tt>net.sourceforge.jtds.jdbc.Driver</tt>
        </p>

        <li>created a directory for the module under <tt>EAP-6.2.0/jboss-eap-6.2/modules/</tt></li>
        <pre>mkdir -p net/sourceforge/jtds/jdbc/main</pre> &hellip; and did <tt>cd</tt> there.
        <p>
          <span class='nb'>NB:</span> the <tt>main</tt> in the above directory path is artificial but
          it is important that the directory branch ends with <tt>main</tt>. The remaining levels are
          taken from the package structure inside the driver's JAR all the way to the sub-package where
          the JDBC driver class is defined. However, I am not sure one has to go all the way there and whether
          the directory structure is not just a convention to ensure segregation of modules.
          In the latter case it may have been equally valid to create the module directory
          as <tt>net/sourceforge</tt> (if we are confident we aren't going to host any other
          modules from <tt>net.sourceforge</tt>) or even some directory structure
          with no resemblance to the package names at all.
        </p>

        <li>copy JAR in module directory</li>
        I then copied the <tt>jtds-1.3.1.jar</tt> to the tip of the above directory tree branch (<tt>main</tt>)
        created in the above step.
        <li>provide module definition file in XML</li>
        I created, collocated with the <tt>jar</tt>, a <tt>module.xml</tt> file with the following
        contents:
        <xmp> $ cat module.xml
          <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
          <module xmlns="urn:jboss:module:1.1" name="net.sourceforge.jtds.jdbc">
            <resources>
              <resource-root path="jtds-1.3.1.jar"/>
            </resources>
            <dependencies>
              <module name="javax.api"/>
              <module name="javax.transaction.api"/>
              <module name="javax.servlet.api" optional="true"/>
            </dependencies>
          </module>
        </xmp>
        <span class='nb'>NB:</span> the string <tt>net.sourceforge.jtds.jdbc</tt> in file <tt>module.xml</tt>
        has to agree with the directory tree created in step #2 so this is not DRY.
        <li>add the driver's definition in the <tt>standalone.xml</tt> file</li>
        Go to configuration directory for the standalone option: <tt>EAP-6.2.0/jboss-eap-6.2/standalone/configuration</tt> and edit file <tt>standalone.xml</tt> in order to add another single <tt>&lt;driver&gt;</tt> element
        under the branch <tt>&lt;datasources&gt;/&lt;drivers&gt;</tt>. This is what the <tt>&lt;drivers&gt;</tt> element looked like when I was done:
        <xmp>
          <drivers>
            <driver name="h2" module="com.h2database.h2">
              <xa-datasource-class>org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource</xa-datasource-class>
            </driver>
            <driver name="sybasejtds" module="net.sourceforge.jtds.jdbc">
              <datasource-class>net.sourceforge.jtds.jdbc.Driver</datasource-class>
            </driver>
          </drivers>
        </xmp>
        <p>
          The element for the <tt>h2</tt> driver was already there, I just added the one about
          the <tt>sybasejtds</tt> driver.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class='nb'>NB:</span> The driver name <b><tt>sybasejtds</tt></b> is entirely arbitrary
          and is basically what's going to appear in the JBoss AEP administration GUI (typically
          at port 9990) when one tries to create a new datasource. It is the module name
          <b><tt>net.sourceforge.jtds.jdbc</tt></b> that has to agree with step #4 and the module's
          directory structure as created in step #2.
        </p>
        <li>restart the server</li>
        <p>
        After the above steps, I restarted the server and when I visited the JBoss EAP
        administrative interface to define a new datasource
        I saw that the driver was already
        recognized and available as an option. I <a href='datasource-definition.png'>defined</a>
        the datasource using the administrative GUI
          and then <a href='datasource-test-connection.png'>tested it</a> (using the same GUI).
        </p>
        <p><span class='nb'>NB:</span> the JNDI name is pretty arbitrary, the important connection
        is the name of the driver <b><tt>sybasejtds</tt></b> which has to agree with step #5.
        <p>
        The definition of the datasource resulted in further
        changes in file <tt>EAP-6.2.0/jboss-eap-6.2/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml</tt>.
        I could obviously have just elected to define the datasource directly in the XML file (however,
          the GUIs option to test the connection is nice).
          </p>
