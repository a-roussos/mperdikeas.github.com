      <li>how to delete a view in ClearCase</li>
      I have only tried this with a snapshot view but I believe it works with dynamic views
      as well:
      <pre>
ct rmview -f -tag mperdike_dev_viewsnap
      </pre>
      <p>
      From what I observed this deletes the (server-side) "view storage directory" that's provided with
      the <code>-vws</code> in the <code>ct mkview</code> invocation for a <a href='#create-snapshot-view'>snapshot view</a>.
      I believe I had to delete the "snapshot view directory" (in my local file system) manually.
      </p>
       <li id='create-snapshot-view'>how to create a snapshot view in ClearCase</li>
      Here's the incantation I recently used:
      <pre>
ct mkview -sna -tag mperdike_dev_viewsnap -vws /data/VIEWS/mperdike_dev_viewsnap.vws -host serverhostname -hpath /data/VIEWS/mperdike_dev_viewsnap.vws -gpath /data/VIEWS/mperdike_dev_viewsnap.vws /export/mperdike/cc-snap-views/mperdike-dev-viewsnap
      </pre>
      Here's my understanding:
      <ul>
        <li><dt><code>-sna</code></dt><dd>this flag triggers the creation of a snapshot view (as opposed to a dynamic view)</dd>
        <li>the <code>-tag</code>, <code>-hpath</code>, <code>-gpath</code> arguments have the same meaning as in the creation of a <a href='#create-dynamic-view'>dynamic view</a></li>
        <li><dt><code>-vws</code></dt><dd>this is an argument that uniquely applies in the case of the snapshot views only.
          It provides the "view storage directory" on the server. In the case of dynamic views the same information is passed
          not through an optional argument but as the mandatory last argument (described in the documentation as "dynamic-view-storage-pname"
          or "dynamic-view-pname")</dd></li>
        <li>the last argument (<tt>/export/mperdike/cc-snap-views/mperdike-dev-viewsnap</tt> in the above incantation) is the location on my local filesystem where
          the snapshot view will be created. I have seen this being referred in the documentation as "snapshot view directory"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      Following the creation of the snapshot view, it is of course empty and one has to edit the config spec. In my case, I already had a dynamic view and just
      wanted the snapshot view to mirror the dynamic view, so I did a:
      <code>ct catcs</code> in the dynamic view and then used <code>ct edcs</code> in the snapshot view to copy
      (verbatim) all rules (selection rules) that appeared in the dynamic view config spec.
      Following that, I added (in my case) a single load rule specifying the vob I wanted to load.
      </p>
      <p>
        So in my case, the dynamic view config spec is:
        <pre>
$ ct catcs
element * CHECKEDOUT
element src/db/... .../dbdev_br/LATEST
element * /main/LATEST -mkbranch dbdev_br
        </pre>
        &hellip; whereas the snapshot view config spec is:
        <pre>
$ ct catcs
element * CHECKEDOUT
element src/db/... .../dbdev_br/LATEST
element * /main/LATEST -mkbranch dbdev_br
load /vobs/ASC_DB_ADMIN/
        </pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the snapshot view's config spec was saved, stuff started to get downloaded. I noticed that in addition to
        the vob I specified some additional ones were downloaded (presumably due to some dependency?).

      <li id='create-dynamic-view'>how to create a dynamic view in ClearCase</li>
      <pre>ct mkview -tag mperdike_dev_view -host serverhostname -hpath /data/VIEWS/mperdike_dev_view.vws -gpath /data/VIEWS/mperdike_dev_view.vws /data/VIEWS/mperdike_dev_view.vws</pre>
      Here's my understanding:
      <ul>
        <li><dt><code>-host</code></dt><dd>the <code>-host</code> argument should provide the server where CC runs</dd></li>
        <li><dt><code>-tag</code></dt><dd>the <code>-tag</code> argument provides the view tag (i.e. a friendly name)</dd></li>
        <li>the <code>-hpath</code> and <code>-gpath</code> arguments as well as the last mandatory parameter take their names
          (as a convention I guess) from the <code>-tag</code> argument and basically specify the view storage location on the server.
          On my machine the <code>/data/VIEWS</code> directory is mounted on an NFS filesystem:
          <pre>
$ df -P -T /data/VIEWS | tail -n +2 | awk '{print $2}'
nfs
          </pre></li>
      </ul>
      <li>common helpful aliases for ClearCase</li>
      <pre>
alias ct=cleartool
alias ci=checkin
alias co=checkout
alias uco='uncheckout'
alias xcc='setenv LANG en_US; xclearcase &'
alias cmake='clearmake -C gnu MAKE=clearmake UIROOT=/vobs/ASC_BUILD/src'
alias ctmv='ct setview -exec "newgrp ccase" mperdike_dev_view'
      </pre>
      <p>Regarding the last of the above aliases (<tt>ctmv</tt>), it seems there is no actual need
        to use <tt>setview</tt>. <tt>setview</tt> spawns a second shell and you are expected
        to navigate to, e.g. <tt>/vobs/ASC_DB_ADMIN</tt> to do your work. Instead, one can
        simply navigate to (in my case) <tt>/view/mperdike_dev_view/vobs/ASC_DB_ADMIN</tt> and have access
        to the exact same information without having to spawn a second shell ontop of the
        existing one (which can cause problems). See <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/q/40347421/274677'>this
        relevant SO question</a>.
      </p>
      <p><b>NB:</b> you will notice that the <tt>ctmv</tt> alias above sets the group as well.
        As such, when one navigates directly to <tt>/view/view_tag_name/vobs/ASC_DB_ADMIN</tt>
        directory the group has to be properly set (with <code>newgrp ccase</code>)
        otherwise some common check-out / check-in commands won't work.
